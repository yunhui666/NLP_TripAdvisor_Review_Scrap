0,"Hotel Edison,  NYC","I would like to mention Rommel Gopez. I have stayed at Hotel Edison before, but it was quite a few years ago. Rommel was so helpful in advising our group prior to and during our visit. In this age of Covid, it was such a relief to feel both safe and welcome.I will be sure to recommend Hotel Edison to all my friends.",5,Gerry E,Dec-21
1,Fantastic hotel in Times Square,"This was our 2nd stay at The Edison and we will be sure to have a 3rd. The signature room we stayed in was clean and comfortable and the staff are always polite and helpful. The hotel is literally just one minute walk to Times Square and the best bar in New York, The Rum House, is situated in the lobby. The Mai Tai’s there are fantastic! Can’t wait to go again.",5,Ian R,Mar-20
2,Another great stay at Hotel Edison!,"Our group of friends enjoyed our recent visit to NYC.  Staying at the Hotel Edison makes it so easy to go to the Broadway shows we were looking forward to.  You cannot beat the location!  The staff is incredible.  From the very helpful concierge to the room service personnel, and, of course, to our friend Rommel, the staff at the Edison is quite simply the best!  We are already looking forward to our next stay…",5,Jean T,Dec-21
3,Girls trip in NYC,"The staff at Hotel Edison were amazing, from the front desk to housekeeping.  We want to give a special shout out to Justina, Tex, Jennifer and Marcos for their kindness and hospitality.  Luidin, Manager, was exceptionally nice as well.  I cannot say enough about the staff at the hotel.  The rooms were nice and with queen beds which are hard to find in NYC.  I recommend this hotel if you want to stay near Times Square.",5,KimC,Dec-21
4,Scott's awesome team!,"Big shout out from 4 ladies from Virginia!  Grisselle, Erick ,and Danny do an excellent job. They were a pleasure to be around every day. Their customer service and warm personalities made the trip so much more enjoyable than any other place. A very safe environment in a great location.",5,Martha M,Dec-21
5,Great stay at a historical hotel!,"Stayed for 5 days, the location was great. The room was very clean and cleaned daily. They offer a coupon gives  two options either sit down breakfast at Friedman’s or to go breakfast sandwich at 45 The Bond, both were delicious.Justina at the front desk went out of her way to help us, making sure we had everything we needed. It was a great vacation!",5,Camille M,Dec-21
6,Perfect Hotel,"Look no further for an amazing hotel. Right beside Time Square, the hotel is on the doorstep to everything.  From shops, food and transport. The subway is just a small walk away which made it easy for commuting to JFK. The in hotel bars/restaurants were great. Food was lovely. Personal preference was that Bond 45 was nicer food but still food was great.The staff…couldn’t do anything more for you. They were all so helpful and friendly. The guest relations manager Rommel was so so so nice! He made us feel extremely welcomed and even organized a surprise gift for my wife given the trip was for her birthday.  They even offer a shuttle service to the airports which is handy…especially with heavy suitcases after shopping. The security team were fantastic too, always in watch and checked that only guests weee accessing the hotel which made us feel that bit extra secure. Will definitely be back and have so many great memories!! Thanks again everyone at the hotel.",5,Martin T,Nov-21
7,Only place I will stay,"I have been to NYC 26 times in 25 years; I have stayed at the Edison 22 times.  I love the character of this hotel, the location, the upgrades in recent years and I love the PEOPLE!    Dining venues onsite offer great options and dining times.  I have stayed in my own and with travel groups I bring yearly.",5,Shelli F,Dec-21
8,A GEM OF A HOTEL,My girlfriends and I enjoyed a wonderful visit to the Big Apple and our stay at the Hotel Edison was the best.  You can’t find a better spot located steps from almost every Broadway show and Times Square. Breakfast was great in both restaurants and we were greeted in the morning by Rommel the guest relations manager. Felt very welcome.  Our rooms were all well supplied and not only comfortable but lovely.  Staff at this hotel all made our trip such a pleasure    We’ll be back in the spring !! Thanks to all,5,Dawn,Dec-21
9,Best Concierge Service!!!,"It's the little things that make all the difference and I can't praise the Hotel Edison concierge members, Jorge and Gio, enough for taking the time to not only help me but make a fun memory for our trip. After a day walking around the city, I realized the pockets on my new wool coat were sewn shut. I asked the concierge if they had some scissors I could use and they not only provided, but Jorge used his knife to cut my seams while Gio held the flashlight! Their kindness is something I will always remember about Hotel Edison and my trip to NYC.",5,OkieTravelerKH,Nov-21
10,"Great location, great hotel!",We stayed for 5 nights over Thanksgiving week. The sit down breakfast is worth the small wait and the grab and go breakfast is perfect. The room was clean and housekeeping came every day. We felt safe in the hotel and the short walk to the Richard Rodgers theater was amazing. Definitely recommend and we would stay there again. All the staff we encountered where very helpful and friendly.,5,Katie M,Nov-21
11,A perfect trip,I was extremely pleased with this hotel and staff. The hotel is steps away from Time Square! Makes it super easy for shopping! They have great restaurants attached to the hotel plus breakfast was delicious! Latoya was my go to girl if I needed anything! I highly recommend this beautiful and historic landmark!,5,Virginia Mae D,Sep-21
12,Heart of Theatre land!,"Although the room is small, it was very comfortable. I loved the Streetwise walking tour near the Evelyn hotel that was complimentary. I plan to do one with each stay. The location is wonderful! I went to the theatre 4 times in 3 days! The breakfast at Bond 45 was delish! Always my “go to” hotel in NYC.",5,Harriett L,Nov-21
13,Terrific hotel right off Times Square -- our New York home!,"The Hotel Edison has been our base when visiting New York for theater visits for some 20 years.  We were FINALLY able to return after two years away this past Thanksgiving weekend -- theater is back, and so is New York!It was like returning home.  Many of the longtime staff who make the place are still here, and as has long been true, the room was immaculate, spacious by New York standards (spend the extra money to get a Signature room), and very well appointed.  Of special note, Rommel Gopez, the Guest Relations Manager, always does an outstanding job of making sure that everything is right.  He is a terrific asset for the Edison; if you have any needs or issues, ask him and he will make it right.We were delighted to be back, and hope to be back in April.  It will remain our New York home!",5,Douglas D,Nov-21
14,Perfect location near Times Square,We have been staying at this hotel for decades and it has greatly improved the facility over that time. The rooms are very well appointed and the staff is wonderful. Rommel Gopez always goes the extra step to make our trip memorable. The fitness room has taken out some equipment in order to do more distancing during the pandemic. Highly recommend this hotel.,5,Brett O,Nov-21
15,Thanksgiving week in NYC!,"Staying at the Hotel Edison is like a trip back home. Located a block off Times Square, in the heart of the Theater district, it's easy walk to many events.It is a busy time to be back in the city, but the Edison is braced for any event. Always with a gracious staff, this luxury hotel harkens back to an earlier time and has kept its flair of Art Deco charm. The newly restored rooms are comfortable, cozy and delightful. The main salon is a great place to meet, flanked by two restaurants with great servers to keep you fed and the Rum Bar, to keep you entertained. There is a luggage check and valet service, or the handsome doormen will hail a cab for you.I never stay anywhere else.The Edison is my place to stay in NYC!",5,Nan,Nov-21
16,Birthday Weekend,Excellent stay at The Edison. No issues with checking in or checking out. Room was clean and breakfast was delish at Bond 54!  Excellent customer service from all those who we interacted with. You are in the heart of Time Square so you can’t go wrong with The Edison.,5,jmcdaniel69,Nov-21
17,Family of 5 granddaughters trip,Right in Times Square within walking distance of everything. We had a two bedroom suite with one king and 2 queen size beds.  Lots of space for a family of 5….4 teenage ladies and senior.  Rooms were clean with good amenities. Great value,5,Elaine D,Nov-21
18,Fab hotel will definitely use again,"2nd time we have stayed last time 10 yrs ago . Fab location and excellent hotel . 2 min from time square . All staff so helpful and security excellent you are checked you are staying in hotel before you get to the lifts . Rooms are spotless and cleaned with fresh towels every day . Yes our bath room needed  updated but perfectly clean . We had breakfast each day excellent choices . Used concierge to book hotel airport shuttle, Woodbury common, hop on hop off bus , so helpful. Rum house bar was our night cap excellent live music",5,Suzanne M,Nov-21
19,Guest,"There are a few things lacking due to the age of the structure and the location of the hotel. But that is also it’s strong point, being a stones throw from Times Sauare, etc.The staff is always striving to be helpful and courteous and this is a strong point. The hotel and our rooms were clean and well kept. The restaurants and bars are a great NYC experience!",4,Norman C,Nov-21
20,My favorite hotel in NYC,This is my favorite hotel in Manhattan.  Great for business or leisure. It is in the absolute best location (located in the middle of Times Square)  with the friendliest staff and very nice rooms. I would highly recommend..,5,Lenny S,Nov-21
21,"Awesome, safe hotel for a couple girls from Louisiana ","Came on a Mother/Daughter trip and had an amazing time.  Hotel was easy to find and so very close to Times Square.  Room was clean, beds were nice and comfy, air/heat made noises at night but, it was ok because we were so tired every night.  Staff was so nice, Marco made sure we were pleased with our room.  I really liked that you have to show your room card to get past the elevator guy.  We felt safe the entire time.  NYPD is on every corner and gladly helped us with directions and which Subway we needed to get on.  We had an amazing time and Hotel Edison was part of it.",5,Danyelle W,Nov-21
22,The best,"Stayed here for a quick wedding and it was everything I needed it to be and more. The staff was beyond friendly, the hotel was clean and incredibly pleasant, and the room was perfect. Special shout-out to Rommel Gopez for his incredible kindness and amazing sense of humor!!",5,Logan M,Nov-21
23,City stay,"Room was small (even though it was the deluxe room) but everything we needed, it was cleaned daily and fresh towels daily which was great, bathroom door was clear so no point in even having one. They took $500 as a deposit on arrival, which they advise you will get back up to a month after your stay. Breakfast was awful, eggs of anytype and an orange or hot drink, if u want anything else you had to pay. We paid $30 one morning for 2x drinks of orange and 2x sets of bacon. Really good location.",4,EnglishTraveller,Nov-21
24,Great customer management,"I would particularly like to highlight the great support from Mrs.Jahai da Escotto, sec. supervisor from the hotel. I lost my laptop bag and she did such a great job - and gave me a perfect support and help me get it back! Thanks to her, it was possible to getthe laptop back in a city as big as new york!",5,Eva F,Nov-21
25,Nice hotel,"I was in Edison Hotel in November 2021. Very good location, about 100m from Times Square. Excellent and professional service by Justina from helpdesk. My favourite hotel in NY. See you next time NY :)",5,Agujka,Nov-21
26,These managers care!,"Hotel managers Scott and Danny treated us like family! Seriously, just imagine being greeted with enthusiasm every time you walk through the hotel lobby. The staff at the Edison really care about their guests. And, breakfast is included either in one of two restaurants on site, or as a “grab and go”.",4,ssd5,Oct-21
27,Slums in Manhattan,"Check in reception was ok, but, all down hill from there, room was tiny, old, wall paper falling off walls, heat would not work, dimly lit with absolutely NO Ammenities in room. Room does not appear to have been updated since it was built in 1931, still probably has same mattress from 1931 too. Mattress was soft and had a big dip in it showing its wear.Tried calling front desk to report, no one would answer the phone,  was on 19th floor could easily hear street noises, sirens all night long. Mattress was old and in need of replacement. They charged $350/night for this dump.They charge an additional fee as deposit of about $350, like someone in their right mind would actually want to steal any of the old crap from the room.Once they get your credit card number, they're done servicing you.",1,Jay B,Nov-21
28,"High volume, Hit or Miss food quality. Poor service!",Charred bacon beyond taste. Cold potatoes. Barely warm eggs. Did not get toast. Server never checked back. Coffee warming not offered. This is a very busy place to eat. It’s difficult to figure out the waiting area as Edison Hotel has access as well as patrons  from 47th St entrance. My breakfast partner’s meal was satisfactory. Floor manager knew what to say and corrected my complaint.,2,Larry T,Nov-21
29,"Excellent location, rooms are comfortable, stylish, and clean","Just got back from a great trip to NYC. Hotel is situated right off Times Square in the theatre district. Several subway lines are just a couple streets (the short blocks) away, and restaurant row is one street and one avenue away.It's a cool old art deco hotel that has been really nicely remodeled. The rooms are clean and stylish, and the elevators are fast - I never had to wait more than 20 seconds, and often there was one waiting when I pushed the button. Plenty of hot water, plenty of water pressure, nice bath towels. Bed and pillows were comfortable. There's security at the door and in the lobby.Really, I could not have asked for a nicer stay. Will definitely stay here again.",5,OB_Dave,Nov-21
30,"Great location, great stay","The hotel was a good price, clean and comfortable.  Staff was attentive and security good. The bathroom was newly updated with plenty of room. The furniture could  use an update. Don't miss Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks who play downstairs at Bond 45  on Mondays and Tuesdays for a trip to the 1920's and 30's.",5,maryiap,Nov-21
31,"Great Hotel, Great Location, Great Price!","My daughter and I were in town for the 15th Anniversary of Spring Awakening concert. I booked this hotel because of its proximity to the theater and because it was a nice hotel for the price. I had stayed there a few years ago. The hotel is even better now! Friendly staff, comfy bed and clean room, and breakfast included in the great price! I have stayed in fancier hotels while in NYC, but paying that extra money seems silly now when I could have stayed here and had basically the same experience. I even love it’s classic hotel feel of the lobby. Can’t wait to come back!",5,msgbwill,Nov-21
32,Appreciation  Staff,"Over the decades,I've stayed at the Edison  on much-loved  ""theater-blitzes"". It was great being able to do so again recently this November, after Covid's restrictions lifted. As a NY hometown girl, I'm used to, and not bothered by NYC staff being brusk -- it's often part of life in this teeming  city.. So when a staff associate is especially helpful, it's noteworthy. My appreciation goes to Mr. Luidin De Los Santos, the Director of the Front Office,  for his polite help in diagnosing and helping me fix my (now foreign) cellphone's problems in accessing WiFi and Cellular. Thank you for adding to my  pleasurable stay at the hotel.",4,janet s,Nov-21
33,Girls trip,"The Hotel Edison is such a great hotel!  We have been staying here for many years.  The staff is so very friendly and helpful. The rooms are always clean and the location is great, especially after Broadway shows, it is walkable distance from most of the theaters!    I would recommend this hotel to anyone!",5,Tina T,Nov-21
34,adequate,"Room was clean and adequate. very small, but included breakfast which was good (nothing fancy). Most of the front desk and staff (5 of 6) who we interacted with were not particularly helpful. My daughter had a clothing issue and needed a safety pin.  Front desk wanted to send it  (a safety pin?) to our room when we were obviously on the way to the theater and acted quite annoyed. So no sewing kit to be had and none to buy in shop. No fridge in room.",3,Erin M,Nov-21
35,Great trip! Will be back!,"I had a great stay at Hotel Edison. The hotel is in a perfect location near Times Square and all the Broadway theatres. I especially appreciated the level of security provided by the hotel. In particular, the hotel staff verified that all people entering the elevators had a room key, which made me feel very safe. The hotel also provided a free breakfast. Thank you, Hotel Edison. I will definitely be back!",5,Katrina,Nov-21
36,Always a top notch experience,I have been staying at the Hotel Edison for almost 20 years on my annual visit to NYC.  I come for two things….Broadway shows and runs in Central Park.   The location is second to none and I have watched the renovations and changes throughout the years and I love that they keep the “old New York” vibe.  The Rum House has still got great live music and Friedman’s is great for a quick bite or a hearty breakfast.    Can’t wait to return in April!,5,island_hopper3700,Nov-21
37,We are so grateful that Hotel Edison was recommended by a friend. We loved the Art Deco flair and art. The convenience f,"We are so grateful that Hotel Edison was recommended by a friend. We loved the Art Deco flair and art. The convenience for attending Broadway shows could not have been better. Yummy breakfast included, too! What fun it was to go on the complimentary neighborhood walking tour offered by Streetwise New York/Triumph Tour with Sonia as our guide. I wish we could have done more of them - so interesting and informative. I highly recommend including this in your stay at The Edison.",5,Liz B,Oct-21
38,Great time!,5/5! This Hotel is in a GREAT location! Staff was professional and friendly! Rooms are clean. There are 3 restaurants/bars located inside the hotel. We will be back!  We stayed  on the 16th floor. The only noise I heard was city noise. But hey —you are staying in a city that never sleeps!,5,Jennifer R,Nov-21
39,Enjoy Hotel Edison,A friend and I recently spent several days at the Hotel Edison. From the "so glad to have you back" check in to the effortless check out our visit was exactly what we needed after a long break from travel! The staff from housekeeping to restaurant workers was friendly and  helpful. Renovations since our last visit make the rooms more up to date while keeping the ambiance of the old Edison alive. The hotel's location is perfect for seeing Broadway shows and subway stations are close by for venturing out.  A wide variety of restaurants and bars are within easy walking distance. We highly recommend the Hotel Edison!,5,Touringandeating,Oct-21
40,Great attention,"Not only does the hotel have a very good location, but it is also comfortable and clean.  But what definitely made my stay pleasant was the attention provided by Justina, who was very attentive every day.  Thanks to her I want to return to that hotel.",5,Robinson,Nov-21
41,very Nice Hotel in Time Square. ,"This is the best place to Stay in Tmes square. They have multiple option of breakfast and we don't need to be in rush to have the breakfast. The Lady on reception desk named yustina is really kind, she explain to us nicely, and relay our order such as microwave and Fridge quickly. Thank you Yustina!",5,cahyo a,Nov-21
42,Great stay!!!,Our visit to Edison hotel was fantastic. The room was beautiful and very clean. We also got breakfast in the morning at the Bond 45 in the lobby and it was delicious. Special thanks to Danny OBrien who made our special night unforgettable.,5,Lily G,Oct-21
43,DANNY MAKES THE DIFFERENCE!!,We stayed in the Edison Hotel for a night to enjoy the city! By the next day we decided to stay another night. But we struggled  a lot at the front desk to keep our previous night rate and room! Also we had a bad experience at breakfast for the lack of service! UNTIL DANNY THE SUPERVISOR SHOWED UP!!  Everything got solved in a minute!! always with a smile and willing to help! He even helped us book some Broadway tickets! That kind of attitude is contagious! His presence there truly MAKES THE DIFFERENCE!! If you stay there make sure to ask for Danny  he will make your day!!,5,BEAT N GREET N,Nov-21
44,Perfect and affordable accommodation in Manhattan,"I stayed in this hotel for 3 nights in early November. It is excellently situated in the heart of Manhattan - at Times Square. The staff of this hotel is helpful as well as reliable and deserves the greatest recognition! All requests for amenities were granted. Special thanks to receptionist Justina for her exceptional kindness and helpfulness. Also, room service was of very good quality.Additional advantage of Hotel Edison is various and decent breakfast (3 venues available) included in price. Lastly, the price of stay is affordable considering such a great location, breakfast included and friendly staff. I will definitely come back to this hotel!",5,Marcin P,Nov-21
45,Great Hotel in Center of Times Square,"The Edison staff was helpful and professional.  Rooms were clean and although I wouldn't call them roomy, they were larger than most Manhattan hotels I have stayed.    Both restaurants -- Bond 45 and Friedman's -- have good food and drink.  Beds were comfortable and the bathroom was great with a very large shower.  Will definitely stay at the Edison when in Manhattan.",5,PasadenaWoman,Nov-21
46,Great place to stay!,"The hotel is central to all theaters in Times Square. The room was clean, the white linens immaculate and there was daily maid service. We enjoyed the hot breakfast daily. The free Streetwise tours were amazing and we learned so much about the area. The staff was very friendly and helpful when we asked questions about transit options and discounted theater tickets. We will return on our next trip to the city.",5,Carolyn R,Nov-21
47,Hotel Edison,"I had a wonderful experience at the (Hotel Edison). Every staff member especially Justina from reception team who was very helpful, hospitable and there for every need of mine. Breakfast was awesome. Thank you so much! Will recommend to my colleagues!",5,DR-Motaz R,Nov-21
48,Hotel Edison is a lucky find in the big city,"Three of us stayed here for 5 nights in adjoining rooms (2 queens, 1 king), and thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Having breakfast available each morning was a bonus--we never ate in the restaurant, but got ""grab and go"" items and coffee each day, which was more than adequate (egg sandwiches, bagel, fruit cup, yogurt parfaits, etc.). The staff at the hotel was so helpful and responsive to my many requests: asked for a refrigerator in the room, needed an extra little table, had problems with wifi, and someone came to my room and worked with my laptop to get it going. As one knows, finding a hotel in NYC is an overwhelming task. I chose this one for its location and the positive reviews, and I was not disappointed. Prior to my stay, Mr. Holder helped me with numerous questions and requests, and this was greatly appreciated and influenced my decision in choosing the Edison. My single complaint was that the front desk was always busy (both checking in and checking out) with an unreasonably long wait. Perhaps one more staff person could ease this congestion.",5,Mary K,Oct-21
49,Great accomodations in the heart of the Theater District & Times Square.,"Comfortable room, vouchers for breakfast. Easy walk to theaters and restaurants and Time Square.Staff friendly and helpful. Will assist with tours and theater tickets and airport transport.We loved the location. Our theater was an easy 5 minutes walk. We had dinner at Bond 45 restaurant right off the hotel lobby. Great Italian food with perfect NY cheesecake!",5,Trish G,Nov-21
50,Great family visit,This is my second time staying at Hotel Edison. The location is great for the theater district and easy to get wherever else you need to go. We had a family suite it was basic but all we needed. Our only issue was no cable or tv. Usually this isn’t an issue if it was just my husband and I but when traveling with kids being able to turn on a show and get an extra hour of sleep is essential. We only stayed one night so it worked out. Also be prepared for a super busy Lobby and elevators! My husband was able to check out The Rum House which he thoroughly enjoyed. Bond 45 was great with the family!,4,RiceMom,Nov-21
51,Trap of a Hotel,"This hotel is a trap.  They sell you a room with breakfast, for what should be “room with ration for breakfast”.  You can have coffe OR juice, no choice of food but for one item.  If you are unlucky and the restaurant is full, they give you a “to go” bag with a choice of a stone cold sandwich and coffe.  Or coffe and the stone cold sandwich.The front desk staff is so aggresive they bark at you for asking questions.Lousy service, cheap treatment.",1,RothenbergM2015,Nov-21
52,Great Guest Service!,"The Hotel Edison was so nice to stay at. Everyone there was so helpful and kind. Justina, at check-in, was the nicest person there. The hotel was also very clean and I felt very comfortable being there in a pandemic.",5,Jessica H,Oct-21
53,I changed my mind,"I was led to believe NYC people were rude. Nothing could have been further from the truth. The staff at the Edison was great. Melissa checked us in (10 of us) and accomplished all of our crazy last minute changes.Keith at the security desk went above and beyond his job. He acquired extra chairs for our suite and was always willing to help.Maid/cleaning service was very flexible and pleasant.Whatever the Edison is doing with employee training and hiring, keep it up. You nailed it!",4,Mary M,Nov-21
54,Security,Keith (From security) Was very kind and helpful. He was always ready to help us with al oír needs. Always satisfecha Good day and Good night very gently.The hotel has a very Good location. And the attention is very Good. It would be Good to have a coffee machine and a friedge at the room.,5,Marina L,Oct-21
55,After a year of Co-vid coming home is sweet,"It had been over a year since we were in NYC and at The Edison.  I worried that the pandemic would have taken its toll with the hotel and the staff.  Happily, when we walked in, (even with our masks on) old friends at the front desk waved and smiled and welcomed us like the old friends.  The lobby shown brightly, our signature room was comfortable.  We felt that the co-vid restrictions were fair, (unvaccinated people were asked to wear masks).  We were checking out late (an options you can avail yourself of for a slight charge), but our housekeeper checked in with us to see if we needed anything in the meantime, so we could get clean towels or more coffee or tea or water.  We very much appreciated her thoughtfulness.  For a large hotel that was filled, I find it amazing that the elevators come quickly, that we weren't squashed so could keep distancing from others (important at this time).  There were lines for breakfast, but they moved fairly fast, and we did pick a popular time to come down, so think about what else you are doing and plan accordingly.  I am personally in love with Friedman's cold brew.  For me, it's worth the price.  I don't know when the hotel opened after the Co-vid shut down, but along with comfortable beds, beautiful bathrooms and the amenities that the hotel puts in the room, the best part of staying here is the staff.  Everyone will make you feel like you have made their day by being there.  You will want to come back again and again.  There is no place like home.",5,April45,Oct-21
56,Convenient Location; Helpful & Friendly Staff,"I take an annual trip to NYC to indulge in Broadway Theatre.  This Edison Hotel is the most conveniently located hotel I've stayed in yet.  The hotel was reasonably priced for a NYC hotel, and although it had come up in searches in the past, this was my first time staying here, but it won't be the last.  The front desk staff, the security staff, the bell desk and the housekeeping staff were very friendly, almost always had a smile on their faces, and were most willing to be helpful and seemed genuinely desirous of being helpful.  This was particularly true on the morning I left the hotel to catch a ridiculously early flight out of LaGuardia.  And again when I got home and discovered that I had overlooked one full drawer of clothing.  Arrangements for shipping that overlooked clothing could not have been more courteous or easier.  Thank you all for a wonderful stay.",5,Larry I,Oct-21
57,Unhappy!,"Other than excellent reception, the room is a dump! Booked a king suite, so tiny, no room to breathe. Bathroom is disgusting, no tub. No separation from shower to the rest of the bathroom. No refrigerator, no amenities. Upholstery ripped on furniture, ""coffee table"" (and I use that term sarcastically) was so wobbly, couldn't put anything on it! Closet door had no paint on bottom of door. Overall, a huge disappointment when taking my daughter and friends for a nice weekend in NYC, would 100% NOT recommend this hotel, you will be disappointed!",1,JHW,Oct-21
58,Good experience,"The Hotel is located 1/2 block away from where you will find all of the fun.JUSTINA is an Agent at the lobby, she didn't need a Manager to take car of me and my wife when we run into minor things and bigger things, she was able to by herself take care of the issues, even changing us from a room where the AC started to malfunction (we are from Texas and like the AC on even in NY is probably not needed now)",3,Sergio Zamora,Oct-21
59,Fine and very concvienient,"Lost & FoundDuty Bound	Deserves a crown.That simple act of doing rightis so expected buy too often … sadly neglected.		 Let me explain! Not one thing can be of more value excepting my sweetheart               or even life.After life the bill fold might come as holding a central role.Just a few years ago my bill fold was lost And yet it couldn’t have been closer.Let me explain through this sad refrain.Gone yes, for three days but then by sheer luck, when sitting on the couch, my left hand fell right on it. Devastated to elated. Even then my vision was 20/20 but the color match was too much, at least for me. So, the preventive answer was to place a bright orange tape on the wallet, a style statement that may solve a 3-day nightmare.  So, the question must be, “What does this have to do with my pleasant stay at the Edison Hotel in New York City”. Could it happen again? Short answer … YES! Let me explain! Even though I grew up in Deer Park, Long Island, New York, I have never had the chance to take in a Broadway Show. So, logically my sweetheart picked the closest hotel, Edison, as it was across the street from the theater showing the marvelous show staring Jennifer Nettles called Waitress.  Too much palaver here so I will cut to the chase. 	As we departed that next day, checked out and awaited the Edison Hotel gentleman to hale the correct taxi, I finally realized my wallet was gone! You do realize that your mind runs wild with all the scenarios that are part of this kind of event. I knew that I didn’t leave it in the room as you naturally do a visual look-about to prevent such a misfortunate event. Well, allowing time for panic to set in, I went the Edison Hotel greeter explaining my sad situation, who called for hotel security to bring me back to my room for a deep search. I went into the room first and made the cursory visual check concentrating on the brown carpeted floors. Nope, it was definitely gone. Grife floods one’s sole. 	Hotel Security did his look about but then he pulled out the smallest flashlight no bigger that a pinkly finger. He must have seen something that needed a closer check. “I see it”, he exclaimed as he reached down toward the skirt that surrounds the king-size bed. Now the ying-yang of despair to joy floods one’s sole. But, due to a very low lighting scene, I never saw where it lay. My cell phone attached to my belt helped minimize the empty wallet feel as it has done before which usually means it was left in the house. No big problem but still a pain. The hard lesson was to place a bright orange tape across the wallet. Well, the next wallet didn’t come with tape attached so none was applied. A lesson Lost!A hug was given, as a tip was never even considered. How can one even reward a service rendered of such a value? He deserves far more for doing his very best and no one can ask more of those hard-working public servants that make a stay at Edison so very fine. He deserves to be named as he made a crisis in formation become another lesson hopefully learned. I realized how very important he became to me.  His name is Security Franis and just by doing his job, he made my life a joy to continue and share. What more can I say or do! Yes, I at 76, hope to return with my sweetheart to the Edison Hotel to attend theater shows at the Barrymore or more! Thank you, Francis and thanks goes to the Edison Hotel. And yes, my wallet now sports a white tape along the brown leather, for visual effect … ‘ya’ know!Robert Concord, NH10/29/21",5,Robert B,Oct-21
60,Great Stay at the Hotel Edison,"Our first trip to NYC in many years. We chose the Hotel Edison because of its proximity to the theater district. The decor was great.  Kind of an Art Deco vibe.  Helpful staff, from the doormen, the concierge and especially Keith at the security desk. Prices were reasonable and a nice breakfast was provided.  This hotel is a little gem right near Times Square and we will 100% stay there again next time we are in town.",5,Judith L,Oct-21

62,"The old was better I miss the historic Edision, Edison lost its class!","I went in 2012 and loved it, Was fantastic went again after renovation and i was so disappointed. Bart Simpson on Lobby wall was over the top, Horrible I died , it was like when clubs went to Disco ,instead of live music. I died. The coffee shop bar was really historic. So many are going to mini splits for heating and cooling and they were FILITHY and had not been cleaned if ever, Sorry Edison.  if you saw the old, historic , you would be sad. Yes update but keep the class. You lost it!The way they store your luggage now for international al travel is horrible and not safe to say the least, First time, it was great, second time, very bad. Wont go again!",2,Terrie M,Nov-20
63,Home Away From Home,"We have lost count of how many times we have stayed at Hotel Edison. We do know it’s been more than 30 years and multiple times during those 30 years. We could not ask for a better experience anywhere. And this October was no exception. From the welcoming doormen, bellmen, and front desk staff to the great housekeeping and excellent security staff, it was an outstanding experience. All the staff greets you with a smile and a helping hand for anything, making you feel like family! The hotel is always pristine clean and well maintained; the rooms and bathrooms have been updated with a great look and feel and include luxury linens and bath amenities. Restaurants Bond 45 & Friedman’s, located in the hotel, are great, plus there is the famous Rum Bar! There is no better location in Manhattan that warmly welcomes you and puts you within steps of the Broadway theaters, subway stops and all the lights of Broadway! It is an exciting experience to stay at Hotel Edison. We highly, highly recommend it.",5,Cathy,Oct-21
64,Great visit at The Edison,"We have been staying at The Edison for 22 years. When we started the rooms were ok but the price was great. Some rooms, called Signature Rooms, have been nicely renovated with very comfortable bedding. Other, Classic Rooms, will be converted in the future.The staff is very friendly and helpful. New restaurants have taken the place of The Edison Cafe and Sofia’s. We well be going back in February.",5,Wayne,Oct-21
65,This one is all about location,"This hotel is located between 46th and 47th streets - about a 1/2 block from Times Square.  There are two restaurants located on either end of the hotel and both complied with COVID requirements and provided to-go breakfasts.  The hotel is right across from the Barrymore theater on the 47th side where Waitress is currently playing.  The location can not be beaten - walk across the street and get right to the theater and avoid any unexpected downpours by quickly darting across the street.The service, especially valet, was excellent.  The hotel and rooms were clean.The rooms, however, aren't a place to retreat and rejuvenate.  Like a lot of NYC hotels, the two queen beds room (small queens) was tiny.  There was barely enough room to put our luggage.  The bathroom had a toilet with a flusher like you would see in a public bathroom and a mirror with a ledge that you would see in a college dorm's bathroom.  The room was clean - it was just old, noisy, and had the bare bones for bathroom appointments.",3,JGTravelReviews,Oct-21
66,My NYC go-to hotel!,"My go-to hotel in NYC! In an incredible location a block from Times Square and within walking distance of all the Broadway theatres & incredible eateries. Nicely appointed, clean rooms, friendly staff, & complimentary breakfast. What’s not to love?",5,Melanie M,Oct-21
67,Great spot in Times Square,My experience at The Edison was really great. My room was very clean as was the entire Hotel. The staff is very helpful. Rommel Gopez was particularly helpful with restaurant recommendations and also with setting up the shuttle to the airport. My mom is coming next week and made a last minute reservation because I had such a great experience. Location is perfect for Broadway shows. Staff always wore masks and so did the guests. It was very reassuring. I’ll definitely be back!,5,Brian Whitted,Oct-21
68,Great Place to stay in NYC,"Danny made our stay!!!The best hotel I’ve ever been privileged enough to stay at. Gorgeous deco hotel, and it only gets more breathtaking when you walk in the deco lobby area. High quality rooms ) and high quality service. Also, can't say enough about Danny Obrien helped us out with the best tourist locations to visit.  Danny and his security team is amazing and really makes you feel safe while staying on hotel property, especially during these dangerous high crime times.",5,Paul D,Oct-21
69,The Staff Was Wonderful,"I always enjoy my time at the Edison. Last week during my stay, I had an accident where I hit my head pretty hard. I was in the lobby and Danny, who is security, sprung into action. He immediately got me an ice pack and asked if I wanted medical attention. When I declined, he escorted me to my room, took my phone number and said since I might have an head injury, he was going to call me every 15 minutes to make sure I was alright. Each time he called he asked if there was anything I needed. He said since they don't have room service, he would be happy to bring food up from their restaurant if I wanted. Luckily, I was fine. In the past I have always felt safe staying at the Edison, but now even more so especially thanks to Danny (who is also one of the nicest guys in the world.) They truly are concerned for the safety and well being of the guests. Well done.",5,ML Robinson,Oct-21
70,Thanks Jennifer and Franklin,I really liked this place . It was close to Times Square and the staff were nice. Two employees in particular were helpful to me. Jennifer at the front desk who helped me set up Wifi on two phones and Franklin who helped me with overly heavy bags even though I no longer had any cash.The rest of the luggage guys seemed to be just standing around both when I checked in and out.The breakfast was good and included in the room so I thought that was good. Overall a very good experience.,4,Nepalisathi,Oct-21
71,Location but,"Good tourist location, subway station close by all the time square advertising just around the corner nice lobby to wait for the long check in line. Friendly staff,room rates o.k. for what you get. Lobby deco 1930s . Be aware of No parking in the City! Meuter Media",4,MeuterMedia,Oct-21
72,Trip to NYC,"Moved my daughter to NYC for an intern and took in the sights while there. Stayed here. Fabulous location in Times Square. Right in the heart of Broadway shows. Hamilton literally right across the street. Lobby beautiful and elevators and hallways very nice. 22 stories. Very crowded. We stayed on the 10 th floor. Room was a decent size for NYC . Only downside rooms need to be renovated very old and bathroom small. Rooms do not look like the renovated ones on the website. Free breakfast for two included is a nice touch. Happening lounges in the lobby, but we did not patron. Overall nice hotel would stay again.",4,Luann C,Sep-21
73,Always A Great Stay,This is the fifth time I’ve stayed here in the past 3 years and it’s always consistently great. The rooms are clean and the staff is helpful. The location is perfect and the price is better than most in the area. I appreciate the complimentary bottles of water in the room each day and the security in place to keep the room floors for guests only.,5,Kelli,Oct-21
74,Got it All!,"This hotel was in the heart of New York City Manhattan and took care of all of our needs.  Check in and out was smooth.  We booked all fun stuff through the concierge including the red bus tour and a Broadway show.  The bus stops were just down the street, grab and go breakfast, restaurant options and very friendly staff.",5,Stay179877,Oct-21
75,Great location,"Hotel Edison was a great location for a Broadway trip. Friendly and helpful staff. My stay included breakfast at one of three locations, I chose Friedman's which was delicious and a generous portion, coffee included. The rooms are small, of course, and the city is loud, of course, but the rooms were clean and the space was used well. A/C and heat worked great. My room was updated but the paint and wallpaper was peeling a bit, but in NYC who spends that much time in the room anyway. The bar downstairs is a favorite of Broadway locals, and the historical lobby is a fun touch. The wifi was also very fast which was nice. Minimal amenities but there are at least 3 Walgreens within two blocks for anything you might need. Also be sure to get cookies at Schmakery's on 45th, so good and you get a discount for mentioning Hotel Edison.",5,al840,Sep-21
76,Hidden costs and fees. Beware.,"I used “TripAdvisor plus” for the first time on October 9, 2021 to select a NYC hotel. I chose the Hotel Edison NYC, NY. When I arrived the hotel Edison staff said they automatically add a $35 “facility fee”. I disputed this both on check-in and checkout and was told to take it up with TripAdvisor plus. Adding extra hidden fees renders the TripAdvisor “deal” meaningless. I would’ve selected a different property if I knew the accurate price. I asked the Hotel Edison staff what it was for and they told me for things that I did not use at all such as business Center, breakfast, water, and the gym. Also the room wasn’t even cleaned properly when we arrived (The bellhop told us we had to go downstairs again and get another room). The second room was not thoroughly cleaned either (coffee dispenser not emptied) but we were running late for tickets at MOMA so we had to just live with it. I emailed “TripAdvisor plus” on Sunday, October 10 and still (October 17) have not had a response. Apparently there is no “TripAdvisor plus” customer service once they take your money. For these reasons, although I think TripAdvisor is great, I would never recommend “TripAdvisor plus” or Hotel Edison.",1,cmbstravel,Oct-21
77,Bathroom Issues,"Hotel Edison has a cool historical lobby. Our room was wheelchair accessible, but we didn’t mind. The night staff was helpful in that there was suppose to be a hairdryer in the room standard. Our room did not have one, and they quickly remedied the problem and rain one up to us. In the morning my wife took a 3 minute shower. The wheelchair bathroom is the toilet and shower head in a small tiled room with a drain running along the wall. The 3 minute shower filled the bathroom with water because the drain wasn’t working. There was still substantial water on the floor 10 minutes later. I asked the front desk for help and they were not understanding of the issue. Marcos insisted that I requested a wheelchair accessible room upon checking in, which we did not. He stated that since I asked for the room I needed to deal with the issue. He eventually said he would send maintenance to check on it but he would not give us a different room. Disappointed in the customer service of Edison.",3,Brian D,Oct-21
78,NYC for sightseeing and a show,"The Hotel Edison is perfectly located one block off of Times Square. The hotel staff is very professional and makes sure all needs are met. We especially appreciated the security to enter the elevators, as they check that a room card is in hand. The hotel is quiet, despite the very central location to the busy area. Restaurants and bars are friendly, and ensuring COVID precautions are enforced.",5,Marla M,Oct-21
79,"Great, established NYC hotel!","Having lived in NYC the last 13 years, I thought I had a good grasp on the hotels available in the city. Admittedly, the Edison wasn’t one of those hotels I knew of and I regret it! My girlfriend had never been to NYC, so I wanted to give her a proper experience. Booked the presidential suite and it did not disappoint! Roomy, clean, high enough from the street where we didn’t really hear construction or cars, and the bed was very comfy. Everyone from check-in to check-out was very friendly, everyone wore masks, and were always there should anyone need assistance. I highly recommend the Hotel Edison if you’re looking for that NYC experience!",4,William D,Oct-21
80,Best trip of my life!!,"Hotel Edison is absolutely stunning, the staff was kind and extremely helpful, the food was delicious, and the room was lovely. My daughter and I arrived a couple hours early, fully intending to just stash our bags and walk around a bit, but they made sure to get us in and they upgraded us from a Classic room to a Signature.The historic building is very conveniently located. We managed to see everything we wanted, and on Sunday only had to walk right across the street to watch Hamilton. I am disappointed I didn’t get a chance to check out the bars, but we were girls on a budget! We plan to head back in March, so I’ll make sure to be better prepared next time, because the ambiance at Bond 45 and The Rum House is spectacular!!",5,hward22,Sep-21
81,"SINCE I AM MILDLY HANDICAPPED, I ESPECIALLY APPRECIATED THE COURTESY OF THE STAFF","The Edison Hotel is right where we needed to be, and the Grab-and-go breakfast was delightful. It was a busy Saturday, but the staff  took time to be courteous and hospitable to us.Some staff member was always at hand to smooth the way for whatever activity we had in mind. Security was tight and reassuring as we were two women alone in the city.",5,patriciany317,Oct-21
82,Very uncomfortable stay,Hotel room dirty and old and completely outdated . They charge additional “resort fee” although there were no amenities to actually use. Beds very uncomfortable and could not sleep from how loud the AC was. Bathroom ceiling paint chipping and small and smelled very musty.Only positive was the location.,2,Catherine F,Oct-21
83,"Awesome Time Square Hotel, Great Location, Service, Clean & Super Friendly!","Love this hotel! It is right in the heart of Time Square. Within walking distance of most Broadway Theaters, Central Park and many great places to eat and drink. I have stayed here twice and will definitely be back. I highly recommend this hotel which also has great service, very clean and updated accommodations and two great restaurants attached.",5,Summer R,Sep-21
84,New Yorks Best Kept Secret,"My daughter and I took a last minute planned trip to NY.  We booked tickets to Hamilton, and spent three days in the city.   You cant beat the location of this hotel.  We walked everywhere we went during the three days AND, the theatre was literally out the back door of this hotel.   The grab n go breakfast was enough to hold us over to lunch.  The Concierge was wonderful.  Arranged our shuttle return to the airport (a red eye flight), she was a wealth of knowledge in terms of where things were located, what to see and when to walk vs waiting for Uber or Taxi.  On that note, basically everywhere we went we could walk from this gem of a hotel.  Its clean, steps off times square, safe, and has a cool historic vibe.   If your on the fence, get off.   The room itself was small but i expected that from a hotel built in the 1930s.  Every corner of the room is updated though and for two of us it was more then fine.  We only spent evenings in our room,never turning in before 10:00.  It was hard to believe the per night stay wasnt higher!    Great price point on top of all the other sell points.",5,T. Brendel,Oct-21
85,Above expectations,The hotel is in a great location. We went for Broadway shows. Less than 5 min walk. Hotel breakfast... INCLUDED... what? Yep. Bottles of water... here you go no extra cost... the room needs some upgrades but bed was good and you can't hear the outside. For what we needed it was perfect. Behind the hotel there's a pizza place hole in the wall... WOW... excellent. Overall staff was great and would go back.,5,EVDGtravel,Oct-21
86,Trip to NYC with stay at Hotel Edison,"I decided to surprise my wife for our anniversary with a trip to NYC. Decided to stay at Hotel Edison located in Times Square. We had the best time of our lives!  Accommodations at the hotel were excellent. Hotel room was spacious and they take cleanliness and safety as a top priority!  All hotel staff including front desk, bell captains and restaurant staff were very pleasant and made you feel at home. Special acknowledgment to the hotel manager, Rommel Gopez. Rommel was very pleasant and attended to all our needs to ensure a delightful stay!  Based on the staff and our experience I highly recommend Hotel Edison as the place to stay while in NYC!",5,Ralph S,Sep-21

The courtesy of the hote","I have been to this hotel many timesThe cleanliness of the rooms is at a 5 star level.Bed linen is changed daily, and the room is thoroughly cleaned.Its location is excellent, right in Time Square.The hotel staff and reception are always helpful and always attentive.General Manager Scott is attentive to every turn and always helps everyone, and the hotel is not three stars is five stars.",5,liorbar134,Sep-21
88,We felt Special!,"My wife and I had the privilege of staying for two nights at the Edison hotel. The hotel was the perfect place to get away for a few days. We enjoyed every minute in NYC and the Broadway shows . We stayed in the signature suite, Our stay couldn’t have been any better. Please convey my appreciation to Danny OBrien who was responsible for making this a very memorable stay for my wife and I. He is truly an asset to the hotel. The Edison hotel is truly a place I will long remember.",5,Chris H,Sep-21
89,"great service, wonderful team",The hotel is located in Time Square but was not as noisy as we thought. We wanted to cancel our last day of stay that was booked by mistake (booking.com) the team and the Manger assist to resolve the problem what a great woman!!  The room are old but such a great service compensate it all.very good grab & go breakfasti'm sure we will be back!,5,Hila B,Aug-21
90,Great Stay,"Stayed for one night in September and the hotel was in a great location! We had everything we needed nearby and had a fairly spacious room! I'm already planning our stay here for next year, with any luck we'll get a similar sized room! The Rum House is also amazing and had such a wonderful atmosphere!",5,Valerie M,Sep-21
91,Excellent Hotel,"I stayed here a few weeks ago with family for an athletic event in NYC.  It was fashion week and the hotel was definitely quite full.  Despite this the service and overall experience were great.  Lines at check in and check out were not very long, and lines/waits at restaurants were either non-existent or brief.  Hotel is in a great location if you need to be in the Time Square area, is clean and has great, friendly staff.  I am going to stay there again when we go see a Broadway show in October. Any time I need to stay near Times Square this is the go to place.  Highly recommend.",5,Chris W,Sep-21

93,Excellent stay,"Stayed here in August and staff was great. Breakfast at Friedmans very tasty. We stayed in one of the signature king bedrooms and it was clean and tidy. Room and bathroom were modern. Location is great, just a couple of minutes from the subway station and Times Square. I'm staying again in October with more friends and family and I have no doubt it's going to be a great stay again",5,Lyanne,Aug-21
94,Freneticly Fantastic,"The bad: covered in scaffolding and in a busy spot that has people pushing you on the sidewalk.The good: you are in the middle of the theater district with access to all it has to offer. The interior is serene, meticulously restored and art decco beautiful. We had a suite on the 17th floor and the view was fantastic. Comfortable for four grownups. Very secure with a gentleman not allowing people without keys near the elevator. Excellent included breakfast. Terrific service from frontdesk to housekeeping. They couldnt do enough for you. In room coffee maker. Comfortable two rooms with beautifully tiled shower. Price ridiculously reasonable. I loved it.",5,BBBBTravel,Sep-21
95,Good for Proximity to Times Square and Broadway Shows,"Good - Got a good rate at this hotel on a travel site (first trip to NYC). Masks were required and vaccine cards checked to enter the restaurants. Things appeared to be clean and the interactions with the staff were good. You can walk from this hotel to Times Square and all the Broadway shows (Waitress was right across the street). Enjoyed the the jazz at the Rum House inside the hotel.  Not So Good -  The room was smaller than expected (hey, it's NYC), and I would call the decor minimal at best (I think there was one picture on one of the plain white walls of the room). I guess I'm saying the hotel is not quite as ""fancy"" as the pics suggest. This may be picky but the comforter and sheet were attached... meaning it's all or nothing as far as bed covering. Maybe that's fine in the winter, but in hot weather that means you're going to have to crank the ac way down and still be hot at night.  Bad - This may have been COVID-related, but there were lines to get into the restaurants each morning for breakfast. Once inside Friedman's, my wife waited 30 minutes for a cup of coffee that never came. Breakfast Tip: The breakfast voucher was good for a placed called Carve at the corner outside the hotel. Their service was faster (and the food was good). General Tip: If you're a first time traveler to NYC, a little bit of Times Square goes a long way. Being close to it may not be such a good thing after a day or two. :)",4,John,Sep-21
96,HiTechModa Week at the Edison Hotel New York Times Square,"Excellent service in all areas. Courtesy, professionalism abound.  When staying,  you must see the Director Rommel.  He is visible right in the heart of things.  He gets things done. The security, housekeeping, and front door attendants are excellent.",5,Michael D,Sep-21
97,Safest area of Manhattan,"I went to celebrate my 11 and 14 year old kids’ birthdays. The news and friends said it was not a good idea as far as safety. It was safe around this hotel. Cops EVERYWHERE in Times Square! Danny, Keith, and Alex made it extra great. Since I was alone with the kids, it was awesome to have these three I knew would have our backs if a problem occurred. New friends indeed were made. I just told my daughter how I miss talking to Danny while we wait to get in the restaurant for breakfast. See you in July Danny!",4,Alana_Regan,Jul-21
98,Hotel Edison�,It was a great location to spend the week in NYC. I was able to walk across the street to watch a Broadway musical.  I also left my watch at the hotel and they found it!  They were also prompt in returning it.   The staff was very friendly and helpful.  Thank you!,5,nosaj2020,Sep-21
99,Best Place Ever!!,"We call Hotel Edison our second home. From the staff all the way from the GM, Scott to housekeeping and everyone in between is what makes this place the BEST ever! They exceed any and all expectations I have ever had and appreciate everything they all do. If there is any issue, they will resolve it. Thank you Scott, Tommy,Danny, Rommel, Gio, Bobby and many of those that aren't mentioned for making our stay amazing. Look forward to our return!!",5,Josh B,Sep-21
100,Amazing Hotel,I have never been to NY before but thanks to everyone at this hotel we had a wonderful family trip. It so close to everywhere you could want to go. I highly recommend trying the Hershey and M&M store my kids had a blast there (well teens). The staff was friendly and the building safety protocol made me feel safe with having my older mother-in-law and kids with me. Time Square was around the corner and fun. I can not stress how helpful and kind hearted the staff was. Not just one person but everyone we came in contact with. The food for the breakfast was great and the servers where so helpful with giving us ideas on where to go and how to get there.  We stayed in the family suite and it was roomie and had 3 beds which all slept amazing. Get the tickets to see shows in the lobby area those women where so kind and knew just the right ones to pick for our group.,5,Lori C,Aug-21
101,"Great location, price and comfortable suite","I would rate this hotel as 4.5 stars with the half star deducted for small service deficiencies. Our suite was spacious, clean and comfortable. It had a small sitting area with a pullout bed which was ideal for our adult son. Services are a bit spotty: 1. Get to the restaurants early for breakfast or you may have a long wait in line. Once in the restaurants the breakfasts were very good. You do have the option to use your breakfast vouchers at a deli down the block. We did that two out of our 4 day stay. 2. Checking in at 1:00 a.m. due to delayed flights we were given the key to a room which was not available. We had to wait while our son ran down to the desk and had our room changed. 3. We were missing a bath mat and wash cloths on two of our 4 days. The front desk phone went unanswered and my wife had to run down there to ask for replacements. Overall, we really liked the Hotel Edison and would stay there again on a future visit.",4,Trek784902,Sep-21
102,Edison is great,"NYC is coming back and the Edison hotel is the place to stay. Location is great and the rooms are big and nice. Only had one incident with a homeless man yelling at me and demanding money from me.  Mr Danny OBrien must have noticed trouble, walked towards the dangerous homeless man and I, telling the threatening homeless man to keep walking and stay away from the hotel main entrance. Seems the homeless man knew of Mr. O'Brien and apologized immediately and walked away. What a peace of mind staying at a hotel knowing our safety is important. Please thank Mr. Danny OBrien again coming to my aid. I'm looking forward to my next stay",5,Michelle S,Sep-21
103,Fun Fun Fun!!,"Fantastic hotel. Great rates room was clean, bed was comfortable and housekeeping was so sweet.  However, who made our family trip was Danny OBrien . He is sincerely a wonderful caring person who really cares for the guests well-being. He even walked us to the R-Train to ensure we were all safe, (Husband, myself and my 4yr old and 5yr old daughters). We will definitely come back..",5,Serenity Q,Aug-21
104,Good last minute affordable stay in great location,"The hotel was very affordable. It also included a decent breakfast.We originally were supposed to be at another hotel who stranded us in the middle of the night when they overbooked the hotel and wouldn’t help us. So we tried to book on this hotel’s website and since it was after midnight I was careful to make sure I searched using the previous day and checking out that day. Then when it came to the confirmation page it didn’t show the dates anywhere, which had me a bit worried. Then when we clicked confirm it said confirmed for the next day and gave no option to change or cancel. (We weren’t the only ones who arrived and had this problem that the website didn’t book the same day like it said it was going to). When we got to the hotel they said it would be outrageously more expensive to change it. Then they said we could wait until 3 am and then pay a hefty early check in fee to check in then.  Finally they said wait a few minutes and we will try and change it once the reservation comes in. Then they tell us there’s no rooms when previously they said there was.  In the end they made it right and changed our reservation without additional cost and got us a room when we thought we’d be spending the night in the subway.",5,acee922,Sep-21
105,Hotel Edison,"Dezigns by Kamohoalii had the privilege os staying at Hotel Edison during our debut at NYFW.  We had 35 plus people in our entourage, Rommel Gopez, Director of Guest Relations was Amazing and went overboard to accommodate all of us.

106,Hotel Edison New York Rocks,"Visited New York with team from Hawai’i for New York Fashion Week, we stayed at the Edison Hotel for 8 days.  We had a Hawaii connection on staff, Director of Guest Relations Romel Gopez, from Hawai’i with so much Aloha Spirit.  We were greeted at the door by their Hotel Staff on Sunday September 5 late evening, their door man was patient with us all trying to organize our bags, Romel was gracious, accommodating, helpful, kind, and friendly to all.  I noticed not just us but to all he came across, in the middle of a busy city Aloha lives.  Their housekeeping staff was all so friendly, and quick to respond to all of our requests.  I would definitely stay there on my next visit to New York.  Edison Hotel you rock�����",5,Kawehilani L,Sep-21
107,The Edison and the amazing staff,"I was apart of the Fashion Team With Dezigns by Kamohoalii partaking in New York Fashion Week and ROMMEL  GOPEZ: Director of Guest Relations was a Godsend. Helpful and supportive the entire week. Always checking on our Team to make sure we had everything we needed to make our trip a success. He really became part of our Team. From the moment we set foot in the Hotel Edison to the moment we left- Rommel made it a point to inform all the staff who and What we are- We Hawaiians are a Cultural conscious peoples, and Rommel and staff were made sensitive of our situation. We were able to utilize facilities at Bond 45, which stored many of our perishable items that were VITAL to our weeks production. Here, we met ANTONIO, who always helped us in every way possible. (Great staff) We were working late hours and early mornings and they accomodated us to the best of their abilities. To the entire staff and employees of the HOTEL EDISON on 47th and 7th- THANK YOU B. KamohoaliiMember of Team DBK NYFW",5,Baba Kamohoalii,Sep-21
108,Great service for held up item.,"I had trouble getting my wallet and keys back from a fashion designer and Security Officer Francis was very helpful every step of the way. I was absolutely distraught throughout the whole process but he was very very helpful. He made me feel heard and on top of that he assisted in the resolution. Great work, I am very grateful for his help.",5,Valerina,Sep-21
109,"Good location, polite and helpful staff","Just visited for birthday holidays and stayed at Edison Hotel. Hotel is located  by few minutes from times Square, everything well organizing, masks and vaccinations rules during visited hotel's restaurants. Cleaning every day in room. They are have conserge service with tours and airport transfers reservation. Knowledgeable conserge Zarina was  very helpful and place which she recommended to visit, inspired me with new sightseeing and knowledges. Sam from front desk helpful and very responsible. Noticed that no heating system in room. Do not know how it warm during winter time. Good luck and thank you for good service.",5,Inga M,Sep-21
110,Comfortable and Safe for our Families 1st New York Experience,"Very glad I chose this hotel for our families first time in New York City. The room was very small compared to what we are used to in other hotels, but it is New York so we expected it. It was very nice though to have three beds instead of someone having to sleep on a pull out sofa. Our room was in great condition, the beds were very comfortable, clean, and the bathroom was very well done and what we could call ""fancy"". We were very nervous about feeling safe in New York. This location was good, close to the populated areas. They have someone at the elevators checking your room key every time which also was comforting. We would stay here again.",5,Emily M,Aug-21
111,Another 5 Star Stay,"My daughter and I stayed at the Hotel Edison during our holiday visit to the US Open. We've both stayed there twice before, and always appreciate the professional and friendly manner of the staff.  It's headed by Scott Geres, the likable General Manager, who keeps the busy Times Square hot spot running with efficiency.  The Area Director of Security, Danny O'Brien, keeps the hotel safe and is a strong presence.  A former NYPD Detective, he takes the responsibility of his position very serious, having an eye for any suspicious activity with no hesitancy to take proper action to protect his guests if and when needed.  We always feel safer when we see him in the lobby. The energy at The Edison also has that great New York 'cut to the chase' friendly vibe.  We often see the staff talking and laughing with guests in way that makes them appear approachable.  Moderately priced stays and big beautiful rooms are also a plus, along with breakfast vouchers, which makes it a 5 star for us again.",5,sarah kaite c,Sep-21
112,Great hotel,All staff are helpful and friendly and our stay was amazing. I was helped by Danny OBrien when I lost my wallet in a yellow cab. He was such a pleasure. I have no idea how he reached out to the yellow cab company but he did some magic which made our stay even more wonderful. Wish we could've stayed longer.,5,Vanessa N,Aug-21
113,Do  Not Stay,"Dirty, small, and poor service. People say only good thing is location. I would argue staying in Times Square is a nightmare in itself. Bathroom too small to turn around, toilet crooked, mildew on walls.",1,Cindy L,Sep-21
114,Loved our stay here,Everyone was nice from Keith the security to our two cleaners but names are slipping my mind would stay here again . Would be 5 stars just the breakfast got me sick but it was free so minus one.  A great way to celebrate anniversary,4,Martin M,Sep-21
115,Edison is awesome and Danny O'Brien is a Gem.,"We loved our stay at this hotel. If you were smart you would visit this hotel anytime you visit NYC. The rooms are very clean and refurbished. On top of that you get great free breakfast, for both hotel restaurants, Bond 45 and Friedman's. More importantly my family and I felt extremely safe. My wife and daughter were out shopping when my wife noticed her and my daughter were being followed by two strange men walking around in Times Square. The two creeps continued following my wife and daughter into the hotel.  My wife said luckily  a gentleman wearing a suit approached them and asked my wife if everything is okay.My wife said she told the gentleman about the two men following them from Times Square. After the two creepy men noticed my wife speaking with  the gentleman in the suit (later finding out his name is Danny O'Brien, head of security), they ended up walking away. Being from Utah we found this very strange. Mr. Danny O'Brien had noticed my daughter and my wife looking nervous and knew something was off as they were being followed. I later found out Mr. Danny O'Brien is retired from NYPD. Great knowing we have Heroes working in hotels protecting us on hotel grounds. We will return to the Edison thanks to Danny.",5,lilaine a,Aug-21
116,Family vacation,"Great location and excellent staff.. Will recommend it to my friends and family. Two minutes away from Times Square.clean rooms, bathroom was a bit small and thanks to Sam I was able to change to a bigger room",5,B.Rachid,Aug-21
117,BE WARNED,"Please note that this should be more properly qualified as a below-regular motel: besides the lobby which is good looking and well maintained, the floors and the rooms are terrible, bizarre, neglected. The floors are ugly aisles of stained carpets and damaged doors with a weird atmosphere. The rooms are terribly maintained: there are stains everywhere, the furniture looks old and very damaged, the bathroom looks quite old and damaged and the installations inside look like a gas station (horrible wc, tiny sink with a simple mirror attached to the wall). The AC is extremely noisy and if you do not get a room facing the street, the views are those of the internal roofs of the other bordering properties (dark, weird and ugly). During my stay, my room lost all electrical power 3 times in 5 days and after asking I never got soap bars (the reception never answered the phone so I needed to go down and still no response). I saw so huge lines for the included breakfast that I decided to avoid it (this might be related to covid-capacity measures). The only good thing might be the location for touristic purposes since Times Sq. is a horrible, dirty and noisy place. For this price, please go somewhere else.",2,simonalamona,Aug-21
118,My Home Away From Home.,This was my first trip to NYC by myself as an eighteen year old. I could not have felt more taken care of and appreciated at this hotel. I felt right at home thanks to the wonderful and caring staff at Hotel Edison. Rommel Gopez is such a kind and thoughtful director of guest relations and I could not be more excited to make another trip to NYC to stay at this hotel. He really went above and beyond to make this trip so special for me. My room was beautiful and clean and could not recommend this hotel more. Can't wait for my next stay!,5,Maddie Scheliga,Aug-21
119,Wonderful hotel and experience!,This is a fantastic place to stay in NYC!! Rommel Gopez was the most gracious and amazing host as guest relations for the hotel. I could not have asked for a more friendly and helpful staff. The room was beautiful and clean and I felt so safe and comfortable during my time here. Hotel Edison will definitely be my go to hotel for all my NYC stays. Highly recommend!!,5,Britt S,Aug-21
120,Great stay at this hotel,This was an enjoyable stay for the week. The staff was very friendly and professional. They went out of their way to accommodate our request and make our stay enjoyable. They also offered great advice and answered and questions we had when we asked for help to get to places in the city. A special thanks to Mr. Keith in security who was incredibly friendly and helpful to us every day of our stay.,5,Quentin C,Aug-21
121,Home away from home.,"Edison Front Desk and Security  was Amazing!!!Great seeing NYC active again. Time square was rocking. The room was clean and bed was comfortable.  Air conditioning could have been cooler but did the job.  Staff made  you feel like family.  Skurt the front desk customer service was friendly and charming. Security Danny OBrien really keeps the hotel safe, god bless him.",5,Amira L,Aug-21
122,Best vacation yet!!,Mr. Kieth (security) went above and beyond anything possible to make this trip even better than we had planned!! The staff was helpful with navigation questions as well as common trial and errors of the big city travel schedules.,5,Shawndale Jenks,Aug-21
123,Outstanding service location and value,"Great staff, very friendly and accommodating. Room was clean, not big...perfect for us. My only issue was no in room coffee maker. The complimentary breakfast at Friedman’s (downstairs) made up for that. Very security conscious: you must show your room key to get on the elevator. INSIDER TIP: Take advantage of the Complimentary STREETWISE walking tour. We took the Hell’s Kitchen tour: nothing like seeing the neighborhood like a native! We were in town to see Springsteen, but this tour (90 minutes) almost rivaled seeing Bruce, entertainment-wise.",5,Mike M,Aug-21
124,Edison hotel the Best and the SAFEST hotel in NYC,"The Edison hotel is one of the most iconic beautiful Art-Deco hotel in New York City. Besides being one of the most intriguing hotel in NYC. The Edison hotel is one of the SAFEST hotel's in NYC. I must say with the scary crime escalating all over. It's such a peace of mind knowing how mindful the owners are with security and safety.  I travel all over the world for business and vacation trips trips with my familyalso stay in high-end hotels such as the  ""W"" and Four Seasons and Ritz Carlton   hotels. Yes, who doesn't love the fancy big name hotels. I must say the customer service is exceptional, so is the customer  service. While staying with the Edsion hotel and for half the price. The major difference is what counts to me and my family, especially with what's going on around the world  security and safety. Which I must say the fancy hotels such as the ""W"" ""Four Seasons"" and Ritz Carlton Hotels do not prioritize and definitely lack with. I had a few bad security and safety encounters in the ""W"" and four Seasons and honestly can say my family and I did not feel safe as we did in the Edison hotel. The Edison security. I experienced the security checking room keys before allowing admittance into elevators, I encountered security checking guest room doors making sure all doors are locked and not left open preventing any crazy unwanted person to wander inside room Housekeeping did not open the room door for my husband when he ran out of room and left his room key inside. The housekeeping politely saying she for security reasons she could notopen room door and assisted by calling  security.  The security officer apologized and explained to open his room door he must be verified as a guest. All said and done My husband was verified and Security allowed him inside room. I must say that is what you call security and safety. My husband at first thought it was a bit of an inconvenience but realizing why the  security officer followed his protocol was only to protect my husband, my children and I. I was alsp fortunate enough to meet the head of security Mr. Danny OBrien early morning while waiting on the restaurant breakfast  line he was organizing. What a caring and wonderful person.  He is truly what all hotels need. He really cares and makes everyone on property fell safe. I even watched Mr. OBrien handle a crazy scary man walk into hotel with a stick in his hand yelling and screaming. Mr. OBrien handled the situation with such calmness and had the crazy person  escorted out of the hotel with police assistance. I asked Mr. OBrien how do you stay so calm in such  dangerous situations. He humbly laughed and said, years and years of practice training and immediately changed the subject away from him and said you definitely have to try the French toast when it was my time to be seated in Friedman's for breakfast.  Edison hotel you are very fortunate having such a wonderful man overseeing your security and safety. The food was also great in the restaurant. I didn't get a chance to try to hotel bar but I guess next time. Thank you everyone keep up the great work.",5,Vanessa S,Jul-21
125,Hotel Edison stay,"Great location -close to PennStation, St James theatre where we saw Springsteen on Broadway hotel room very clean- had two queen beds-all hotel staff very helpful and friendly. Breakfast included with a variety of choices.",5,JeanLarry5474,Aug-21

129,Mini Vacation!,Thank you so much to Rommel for making our stay amazing! The hotel was beautiful and the staff was so nice and helpful! We loved the location of the hotel and the recommendations of places to eat were great!,5,Rebecca E,Aug-21
130,Great experience.,"My friends and I had to change hotels last minute and this was a great find. I was hesitant as a first time to NYC traveler.    Everything was great from check in to check out. Security was good, elevators, water pressure all good.  Great convenient vending and workout gym.  I will most definitely be staying again when we go to Broadway.  Oh and breakfast which was free was good value as well. Great history.",5,Christopher H,Aug-21
131,"Good Hotel, Bad Restaurant.","We stayed 6 nights at Hotel Edison. The staff were professional, efficient, and friendly. The hotel is located at a perfect spot about 2-3 minutes from Times Square center (Broadway). The young lady at the concierge desk was very helpful and knowledgeable about what to do around New York.  We were first assigned a room on the third floor that was not great, but we were quickly moved to another room on fifth floor once I complained about the room. The room cleaning crew were outstanding and always clean the room nicely every day. The only disappointing thing is the horrible experience with the breakfast at Friedmans restaurant. They were 45 minutes late to open the door and lots of guests were waiting in line outside without getting any explanation. After close to an hour when we were let in, a staff named Peter came to our table and asked if everything was ok. When I told him it’s not okay for them to open 45 minutes late when a lot of guests have been waiting in line for an hour. He said, they were out of gas and could not cook. I told him at least someone should have informed us what was going on, he said they don’t owe anyone explanation. The next day we took the breakfast voucher to Carve Restaurant on 8th and 47th. The food at Carve was great and the service outstanding. I am giving 4 star because the staff of Hotel Edison listened to my complain about my encounter with Peter at the Friedmans Restaurant. Not sure why the hotel retain relationship with the restaurant, since the staff at the restaurant are quick to point out that they were in no way affiliated to the Hotel.Overall, I can still stay at Hotel Edison in the future. I will only be smart to stay away from Friedmans Restaurant.",4,Fred O,Jul-21
132,Great Experience!,"I can not say enough about the hotel and it’s accommodations, cleanliness, food, drinks and staff!   Particularly Rommel Gopez… we were greeted by him at the lobby and he ensured all our questions were answered and needs met.  He was quite knowledgeable about the area and recommended some great spots! His professionalism and courtesies made the experience at this hotel that much more memorable.  We will definitely be back!  C. Maldonado",5,Connie M,Jul-21
133,"Great Location, pretty quiet","Positives:- The Price was right.- Location to Times Square (about 80 steps). - Considering the location...relatively quiet.  - Restaurants on site had great breakfast. The EndNegatives:- first impression upon entering the room: rehab center?-- very boring & plain.- Bed was OK- Carpet had wrinkles in it.- Ceiling had holes in it- Nightstand was peeling formica- Bathroom was one wet cell, all tile, toilet & sink all together- Water temp was very warm to scorching- Booked for 3 people, room only has towels for 2- Booked for 3, got ""free breakfast"" vouchers for 2 peopleBottom Line, Great Location, Quiet, right price.

134,#1st  time visiting New York City..GREAT STAY!!,"We recently stayed at Hotel Edison and I must say our experience here was top notchThe entire staff were very friendly from the moment we stepped inside. The lady who works the kiosk was very friendly, super helpful and full of information. They provide free breakfast for two which was very good and yes the lines may be long but the line flows very well, we stood in line but for only 15 minutes before we were seated. our servers were GREAT and food came out really fast. They have a grab and go at a bakery few steps away and they have great variety of pastry and bagels,  you can eat there as well. We stayed in the classic room from what I know these rooms have yet to be updated but we were very impressed 2 Queen size beds, very comfortable and clean yes, may be older Hotel but very nice! Location Location Location!!! we were steps away from times square and so much to do all around. I took ear plugs just in case of noise but we heard nothing from our room and slept very well and comfortable. I highly recommend this Hotel and we definitely will book here again!! The staff works hard and made us  feel very welcomed!  I give this Hotel A 10 out of 10.....Thank You!!!",5,weatherslynda,Aug-21
135,First time in NY,We visited for the first time NY so we tried to book in the best place according to the downtown and Times Square. This hotel has an amazing location just 1 block from timers square so to take any train or bus is really handy. Regarding breakfast there’s two and almost 3 places  to have it 2 on the same hotel (just try to weak up darkly otherwise the lines are horrible) also the 3rd is outside the hotel and just food to go. Room was cozy and with nice space but our view was facing the ally and definitely was no sun light at all. The kiosk for self check in was good and handful. During night time despite the amazing massive amount of rooms per floor there was no noice and we were able to sleep with no issue. Finally regarding room cleaning was fine but unfortunately is a veeeeery old hotel so if you are expecting something other than old rooms and very noisy elevators you’ll have to chose another place.,3,gabriel v,Aug-21
136,A memorable experience in NYC!!,"Me and my girlfriend had a fantastic stay at the hotel Edison. As soon as we entered we were greeted by the manager, Mr. Scott Geres who recommended carve for a place to grab breakfast the following morning, with our complimentary breakfast vouchers. We did just that and we’re delighted to find a wide variety of different breakfast options to choose from which put a smile on both our faces. Our room accommodations were spectacular with gorgeous views of Times Square! Our spacious suit had all the essentials and more! Our rooms were cleaned both days and beds made. Looking forward to returning to the hotel Edison to experience another premium stay in the big apple!",5,Roy P,Aug-21
137,Wonderful stay at the Edison,"My partner and I really enjoyed our mini getaway in the city. Everything about our stay was amazing, our room was chic, clean, and we had a great view of the big Apple. The staff was very nice and we were greeted by the General Manager Mr. Geres multiple times, which made us feel comfortable at our home away from home for the weekend. He recommended the Carve Cafe for breakfast which was on the voucher. The place turned out to be great and convenient! We will definitely be coming back to the Edison next time we are in NYC.",5,Isabella C,Aug-21
138,We really enjoyed our stay.,"I stayed here a year ago with my partner and we had amazing stay.  Clean and very quick and helpful staff.  Check in was easy, restaurant downstairs is perfect for breakfast.  I really loved it here.  I would recommend it to anyone.",5,Dawn,Oct-20
139,Loved it!!!!,"My friends and I stayed here for a long weekend during our visit of the city. The location is simply perfect.   We were pleasantly surprised, the room had everything and more than we could have asked for and was very clean. The view outside the window overlooking Times Square was breathtaking as well!  The staff was very attentive, professional and friendly.  I want to give special thanks to Rommel Gopez, who really went out of his way to make sure that we had a wonderful stay.  We also enjoyed the hotel’s restaurants/bar which are conveniently located inside the hotel (Friedman’s, Bond45 and The Rum Place).  Thank you again Hotel Edison for an unforgettable weekend!  I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone.",5,Ines E,Jul-21
140,Yesssss We're back at it!!!!! Love New York...,"Looking for a great hotel to stay in the City?  Look no further stay at Hotel Edison.  We stayed there in July and had an excellent experience.   From the time we arrived to our departure.  We stayed in one of the Family suites.  Room was top notch, clean and sanitized with all the amenities needed for a pleasant stay including Bars and Restaurants .  Hotel Staff were pleasant and helpful during our stay with special thanks to Rommel Gopez who insured all our needs during our stay were cared for.",5,Marlen S,Jul-21
141,Absolute perfection,I had an amazing stay at The Edison. It was in the heart of Times Square and was just perfect. Rommel Gopez made all the difference for us. He had gifts for us and sincerely cared about our experience. I never felt as though he were annoyed or not enjoying his job and it made such a great impact. We will be back!!!,5,Logan M,Jul-21
142,Best value in NYC!,"I arrived a little early, but they checked me in, which they do to save a mad rush at 3 pm. Normally after checking in, you can check your luggage but can’t access your room until 3 pm. The concierge suggested a room upgrade  — for $30 more I could have a “Signature” room; king size bed, newly remodeled, free bottle of water, Starbucks coffee,  and lovely view. I took the deal and Justina said my room was ready so I was free to go on up. I’ve stayed here many times, and this is by far the nicest room I’ve ever had. It was totally worth the extra $30. I’ve always loved the Edison, with its Art Deco lobby and three onsite restaurants (breakfast included in the room price!), and its proximity to everything. The only problem with this room I’m in now is that I don’t want to leave it, even to soak up the atmosphere of my favorite city.",5,Cathy R,Aug-21
143,BED BUGS,"I have bed bug bites everywhere. I didn’t want to believe it but they are 100% bed bugs. Do not stay here! Dirty, dark tiny rooms. Walls are also so tiny and you can hear everything. Kids running up and down the hallways screaming",1,Cassie M,Aug-21
144,Not bad,"Hotel Edison turned out to be a pretty good place to stay while in NYC. I was in NYC for two weeks and stayed at this hotel for the second week of my trip. When I first pulled up to the hotel in my Uber and saw the crowded lobby, I thought ‘OMG’. I had stayed in a smaller, quaint hotel in the village the week prior and this place was the exact opposite. The lobby is a zoo. It’s full of tourists in green, foam Statue of Liberty hats who are excited to be in the city. It’s not even a block to Times Square (which I detest), so if that is your thing, you will be right at home here. I arrived early at 11 am. There is a line for the front desk. A long line. And it moves excruciatingly slowly. Lots of people checking in using passports and paying in cash, which takes longer. I will say that when I finally got called to approach, the desk agent was super friendly and took my number and promised a text when my room was ready. I stored my luggage for free and went to roam the city. Two hours later, I got the promised text stating that the room was ready. I returned a little later, got back in excruciatingly slow moving line and got my keys to check in. I asked the front desk agent if I had to get back in that ridiculous line if, for some reason, my key cards stopped working. His answer was ‘unfortunately yes’. My room was on the 11th floor and had a queen bed. It was on a back corner of the hotel and had two big windows. The view was not bad but not great either, as it just looked onto neighboring buildings. They honored my request for a room with a bathtub. The first thing that I noticed was that the room was really old and banged up. The walls and trim had 75 years of paint jobs on them and the door to the bathroom was original. The carpet was old and needed to be replaced. But, despite all of this, the room was spotlessly clean and  the bed was super comfy with nice linens. The bathroom was overdue for an update as well, but, again, very clean and tidy. The Bigelow toiletries were a nice touch.  There was a flat screen tv with lots of channels and plenty of storage space for my week long trip. To my surprise, I received housekeeping service daily. So many hotels are still operating with limited housekeeping, if they offer it at all, so this was appreciated. I left the housekeeper a nice tip. The hotel, like most NYC hotels now, charges a bogus ‘resort fee’ of $31/day plus tax. I hate these fees and just wish that the hotels would increase their nightly rates and be more transparent. One of the reasons that I chose the Edison was because the resort fee included a ‘free’ breakfast. Each day as I made my was down to the lobby I saw the line for said ‘free’ breakfast and each day I decided to pass. There is a Dunkin Donuts around the corner and I got my morning coffee there so I essentially got nothing for my $31/day. There is a bar off the front lobby which seemed very popular and I heard live music from there during the weekend hours. When you enter the hotel there is a suited security person by the elevators and you must show your room key to approach. Luckily my key card never stopped working so I avoided getting back in line for the front desk. Upon checkout, I used the self serve kiosk which worked great and saved me a lot of time. I never really interacted much with the staff until checkout when I decided to ask one of the bellmen for assistance in hailing a cab to the airport. Cabs are scarce now in NYC and his assistance was greatly appreciated. It turns out his name is Bobby and he’s been at the Edison for 40 years. I really enjoyed chatting with him and he was very thankful for my tip. Overall the Edison is not a bad place to stay, just be aware that you’re going to be in the madness of Times Square and be prepared for a long line if you need the front desk. Fortunately, I only needed a place to sleep and shower and the Edison was perfectly fine for that. Would I stay again? Yes, but only if I got a fantastic rate like I did for this trip. I gave the hotel four stars (added on an extra star for Bobby the doorman).",4,nyclover18,Jul-21
145,Great location,"Great location and a historic, beautiful hotel. The staff was very nice and reponsive when we needed a repair and some housekeeping items. Beautiful lobby which was often hectic, but there was staff letting us know where to line up. The room was small but efficient and had everything we needed. Comfortable bed, good coffee and tea, nice shower and bathroom. Easy to hear noise from the hallway. We received breakfast vouchers for 3 different locations. It was a comfortable stay.",4,Dansker58,Aug-21
146,Awesome Staff,"Regis, Danny and Alex are awesome. My son left some items behind after check out, which we did not realize until we got home. We contacted the hotel assuming the items were lost forever but, the Security Manager Alex was more than helpful. He had his staff secure the items in a safe place and told me exactly how to retrieve them. When I arrived at the hotel Regis and Danny were very busy but, took the time to help me retrieve the items with a smile on their faces. So grateful for this staff and this hotel, can't wait to go back.",5,M L,Jul-21
147,THANK YOU DANNY!,"Our room was a bit “dated”, but the kindness of the staff was unparalleled . When we had to leave unexpectedly after the first night, the manager (Danny) was so helpful with all of the last minute details of our early departure. The folks at the front desk were also amazing.",4,Danielle H,Aug-21
148,Excellent Stay,"5out of 5We had an overall excellent experience at Hotel Edison! The staff said the hotel had been closed for 14 months due to Covid and they were happy to be back at work and it showed! Everyone we encountered was friendly and helpful! We had daily maid service in our room, so fresh towels and made-up beds were nice to return to. We felt very safe, they had a doorman greeting all hotel guests and a bellman standing by the elevators checking for hotel keys. Even if someone managed to get by, you cannot use the elevator without swiping your keycard. The location can’t be beat- right next to Times Square! The only negative would be the breakfast, I selected a hotel that had breakfast included, but you only get two vouchers per room. We had 4 people. So two mornings we ate at the hotel and the other two we enjoyed Krispy Kreme then authentic NY bagels. It was a win! The building is a little older, but the location and staff outweigh that.",5,JennyCTx,Jul-21
149,Thank you Jahaida!,"Thank you very much for the supervisor Mrs. Jahaida See for her great efforts in helping me finding my missed bag in a cab, it took her almost 2 hours trying to reach the taxi company by phone and online in addition to her efforts to guide me to check in police stations for lost properties. Greatly appreciated.",4,ramseynagham,Jul-21
150,Good value but be prepared for long breakfast queues,"Bizarrely, this hotel does not reply to any e-mails. I had to make several  international phone calls instead - an  annoying start. The hotel itself lives up to its billing as an attractive art deco, well located and good value place. The room was big enough with nice bathroom. The queues for breakfast however were long (10-30 minutes). There were also on occasion queues for reception but the staff were  helpful, especially on the front desk.",4,Trail17725242720,Aug-21
151,bad experience,"I stayed for 14 days. I always had to queue long,  at the front desk, or for breakfast (they only give you 2 bouchers for breakfast, if there are more in the room, it is not free), they serve you in very bad ways, the rooms do not have a coffee maker or a minibar, I had to ask them to give one, because otherwise I was leaving. Very basic and old furniture. Super small babthroom. Poor treatment at the front desk staff, all the time ! , and queuing for 20 min, 10 min or 30 min according to the schedule, for whatever. There is no courtesy anything with these people. From the bedroom call, they  rarely answer  because they are always busy. I can only speak well about the cleaning . Uncomfortable, old and bustling hotel.",1,Andrea A,Jul-21
152,Good hotel and great walking tours,"A great place to see Manhattan. Right at the city center and near times square.The hotel is good enough. Great staff, everyone is very helpful and included breakfast is a pro.The hotel provides free walking tours around the area. They are really great, the guides know and love what they are doing. Definitely recommend to use that option if you are into history and architecture",5,Vitaliy,Jul-21
153,Finally back to a home away from home!,"After many many long months, I was delighted to come back to the Hotel Edison for a long weekend visit.  My last travel date was March 2020, ( also included a Hotel Edison stay ) and I couldn’t wait to return.  The staff, as always was very welcoming and helpful. I was very impressed with all the Covid precautions that are being implemented. and strictly followed.  Staff are going above and beyond to be sure guests feel safe, secure and comfortable.  I know I surely did!!My Junior Suite was roomy and impeccably clean. It was great to see that Bond 45 and Friedman’s are open and serving delicious food, without the need to go further than the lobby. Thank you to the staff for making my first trip back after a long wait so very memorable.  I definitely recommend staying at the Hotel Edison.",5,gm14142017,Jul-21
154,Amazing hotel with lovely staff and perfect location,My friend and I decided to go to our first big trip since the start of COVID and Hotel Edison did not disappoint. The whole staff was super friendly and helpful and we even got complimentary breakfast. The location was very convenient to all the places we wanted to go to. The room was clean and had everything we needed to have a restful stay. Planning to come back with my family!,5,Liora,Jul-21
155,Hotel Edison is Awesome!!!,"I had an amazing experience staying at the Hotel Edison.  The staff were all wonderful and very accommodating to my needs!  I felt very secure during my stay! Great breakfast too!  The Hotel Edison is centrally located to many attractions i.e. Times Square, Broadway and Central Park just to name a few.

156,Love New York,Hotel service was wonderful. Keith was very helpful and professional. Will definitely come back.Really love the security really safe. Breakfast good. Nice and clean. Right next to downtown New York and Broadway. Perfect location to go near all attractions with your family.,4,Flo,Jul-21
157,Great stay 10/10 would stay again!,This was the second time in NY first time visiting hotel Edison and I would recommend this place to anyone from now on! Staff was amazing and accommodating. Arriving at 5am they allowed us to check in our bags and looked for an earlier check in time for us with no issue. The security on site is great requiring room keys for entry to elevators. Breakfast vouchers were great each morning and staff was friendly and funny. Lastly Skint and Danny were able to secure a late check out time since our flight was not until 8pm! Awesome experience with this place and you are missing out if you don’t stay here!,5,Laura R,Jul-21
158,A most delightful experience at the Edison at Times Square.,"Best location in NY, just at Times Sq.  Friendly and efficient Staff, very clean. Covid and security minded. I would like to specially refer to the most friendly and helpful doorman Bobbie. Walking distance from all major NYC attractions. Most recommended.",5,DubieDunietz,Jul-21
159,Best place in Times Square,If you will be in New York for a stay then Hotel Edison is where you want to be. Beautiful place with in house restaurants and the best staff around. Security is a priority here to with staff at all entrances and card scans to go up in elevators. You need to choose this place if you’re coming to New York! Just steps from Times Square!,5,Gina B,Jul-21
160,Great vacation,"Excellent location, great service and hospitality. Room small but very clean. Comfortable for a couple. Great security and very friendly staff,  specially the room cleaning ladies. We had a great time, can't wait to go back!",5,L Carrion,Jul-21
161,Keith,Keith is the best in customer service! A++ Our TV was not working on arrival and he got someone right up to our room to get it going. It was late in the evening but that didn’t matter to him. He is always so cordial and friendly. Thank you Keith in Concierge services!,5,Renee' C,Jul-21
162,An Art Deco Treasure,"I've been staying at the Hotel Edison for all of my trips to NYC for over 22 years, and I must say that the experience of staying there is just getting better and better. This art deco hotel is a gem in the theater district...a short walk to Times Square and many other landmarks and attractions. The rooms are very comfortable and clean - some are small and have limited views, but they are more than adequate for the purpose of recharging your batteries for a fun day (and night!) in the Big Apple. The staff are very friendly, very helpful, and very good at what they do. I'm already looking forward to my next stay at the Hotel Edison in September. Give this hotel a try - I hope you like it as much as I do!",5,George F,Jul-21
163,Fabulous,"This is a top notch hotel.  We enjoyed absolutely every minute here! Perfect for families.  The neighborhood is fantastic and safe!!  We had a signature suite and it was a two room hotel.  Perfect for a family of 3 or 4.  The concierge services were top notch.  Bennie at the concierge desk is so friendy, helpful and knowledgeable.  The breakfast was delicous.  The hotel staff are top class!",5,Anissa H,Jul-21
164,Looking forward to a great stay,"After reading the reviews and looking at the location, we have booked Hotel Edison for our upcoming trip 7/30 - 8/4. Kids are super excited and hoping we will be able to get a room with a view/terrace. We will try to call as well as request at check in, hopefully it will work and we will have a great stay. I will update the review upon return with first hand experience.",5,rkumar3,Jul-21
165,Great Hotel,"Great location , accommodations excellent,  great location. Group will return in December. This will be my new go to location in NYC. Beds were comfortable and the hotel and rooms clean. I felt safe. I recommend Hotel Edison",5,parsassy1,Jul-21
166,Business Trip to Time Square,"One night stay at the Edison was lovely! The staff was very friendly, our room was clean and updated. I was upgraded to the king room instead of the queen that I paid for which I greatly appreciated. The check-in was semi flexible. Would certainly stay again my next time to NY!",5,Kayla K,Jul-21
167,Wonderful renovation,"We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Hotel Edison. I was impressed with the freshly restored art deco murals, fixtures, and even the lobby tilework. The staff was incredibly friendly and the room was surprisingly large for midtown Manhattan. The room was likewise nicely appointed and upgraded.",5,Bruce B,Jul-21
168,Family friendly fun,Great location near Time Square!  Staff was very friendly and helpful. Free breakfast was included with our package deal and was quick and easy as well as delicious. We had a small problem with our reservation and they immediately made it right and upgraded to a larger room. The only reason I'm giving it four stars (I would give it 4.5 if that was an option) is the wait time for the front desk was too long.,4,beacher,Jul-21
169,"Centrally located, Great service","I came into town for work and needed to stay close by because I was on a time crunch. I found Hotel Edison and was pleasantly surprised by how affordable and comfortable it was. After I left, I realized that I had left my jacket in the closet. 10 days after leaving, I was able to get in contact with Alex who confirmed that they had my jacket and the following day, Danny helped me out by returning my jacket to me safe and sound AND letting me check my bags with them so I could have lunch without dragging my luggage with me. Thank you so much!",5,Nancy L,Jul-21
170,Stay in affordable style!,"I thought I was booking a different hotel, but when my booking was confirmed and I saw the address, I was like ""OK- it's midtown- no biggie."" It wasn't the location or the hotel I was expecting, but boy, was I happy with my lack of attention when making my original reservation. Hotel Edison is conveniently located and nicely appointed. We had a room on the 9th floor, and I was immediately dreading the ""wait for the elevator"". I have never seen such a well run and reliable system in a New York hotel. The hotel was clean, and I loved the art deco appointments. The room was very comfortable. The hotel even offers a complimentary umbrella for guests. Staff was easy to find and were always efficient and friendly. I would definitely go back.",5,Minamo67,Jul-21
171,Amazing experience and location!,"I stayed at this hotel one night to see a show uptown. The location is unbeatable and safe at all hours. There was also no noise concerns because it's located just off the heart of Times Square. The view in the upper floors is beautiful. The bathroom and room was clean, the hotel staff incredibly kind, and the elevators quick and efficient. It was the perfect way to treat myself to a show in NYC and explore around me at all hours. I'll definitely be back again!",5,Lili,Jul-21
172,Great Service,"After having some ""drama"" with nearby hotel being closed and not informing me, Hotel Edison saved the day. Luckily a colleague of mine was also staying at this location recommended it and minutes after reserving online front desk gentleman was able to check me in early. Great location at the center of everything. Breakfast voucher, delicious. Great spacious room, friendly staff. Definitely coming back and recommending to friends. Thank You!",5,Ade,Jun-21
173,Employee Justina,Justina ( front desk check in) was exceptionally helpful and went out of her way to sure we had the best experience while we stayed at the hotel.  We had a room that I has scheduled online and it was not the best fit for what we were looking for.  She set us up in a better room suited for our needs. She was very personable and made us feel very welcome!!,5,Heather S,Jun-21
174,Amazing experience first time nyc trip,"Stayed for 10 days , traveled alone.the hotel staff felt life family! The room was very clean, and nice view I felt very welcomed , and they helped me with everything I needed.Danny was the nicest person i met in New York !!Every day asked me if i need anything, and how was my day.. i had a late flight-  long after my checkout, And still offered his help with breakfast, and water, even thanks to him met a person on the same flight and we took uber together Also adelle from the transportation and reception, was very patient, and helpful planing my first trip to nyc Was to do and how to het there !

175,"Outstanding hotel, I highly recommend it!","The rooms were very clean, comfortable, and the staff were amazing. They went over and beyond to help make our stay enjoyable. I highly recommend this hotel for anyone visiting New York and would like to stay in Times Square.",5,Kate M,Jul-21
176,Concierge made sure my trip will always be remembered,The concierge (Yustina was manning the front desk) and other service providers in Hotel Edison were top notch! Such attention to detail. They made my stay quite memorable through their kindness and pervasive smiles. I will definitely return.,5,Andres M,Aug-20
177,Can we bring our housekeeper home with us?!,"When we first arrived, construction at this location had us off to a bit of a rough start. I spoke to Leoden the manager and he took great care to ensure we were moved to a better location. Thank you!  This hotel is in a great location within minutes walking to many tourist attractions, bus stops, and subway stops! Our family suite room is spacious for a NYC hotel. Our favorite part though, is our housekeeper Mada! She is happy, helpful and friendly. She does a great job and always asks how we are doing. She even remembers our names! I wish we could take her home with us. LOL",4,Vikki C,Jul-21
178,Amazing!,I just returned from a trip to the city and stayed at Hotel Edison. This place was so amazing and in a perfect location. It was clean and the staff were so friendly. Dan & Scott made our whole group feel right at home. I couldn't have asked for it to have been any better and I have already given the hotels information to two other groups of people that I know who are planning a trip. Thank you all so much!!!,5,bgthompson,Jun-21
179,Best trip,"Recently we spent a week in the city, we stayed at hotel Edison and it was amazing as always. The staff went above and beyond to help and show us the best time, we stay there every year but this was the best, Danny and Scott just helped make this trip extra special from reservations, suggestions, upgrading a room, getting rides they just made our trip to the big city everything you could ask for and more. Thank y’all so much, can’t wait to visit again.",5,Melinda N,Jun-21
180,Good price for a place so close to Times Square,"The lobby was nice and the dining room was beautiful. Price was really good considering the location, it was close to the tour bus stops, Times Square, and Central Park. The free breakfast was also a nice touch.",5,Angie B,Jun-21
181,It was ok,"The beds were uncomfortable, there was paint peeling from the ceiling, mold in the bathroom, our electricity went out 4 times, our AC stopped working, the line for breakfast was long and the food was not worth the wait. Way better breakfast at carves down the road!  The 3 out of 4 times they would not answer the phone when we called from our room and we would have to go downstairs and wait in line. They only had one person at the front desk too so it always a 10-20 minutes to talk to someone.   BUT the staff was amazing, so nice and friendly and the Bell men’s were very helpful! The location was perfect too. This was the only thing that made our stay good.",3,Lorah519,Jun-21
182,"Classic, Yet Charming Hotel",My first trip to NYC and our stay was exceptional.  Staff was professional and helpful with any questions we had during our stay.  Please visit the Bond 45 bar/bistro on the first floor near the door on 46th.  Great staff and superb drinks!  Our rooms were cleaned and sanitized during our stay.  Safe atmosphere but protective of guest's comfort too.   I will definitely stay here the next time!,5,K & M Ranch II,Jun-21
183,Great experience,"Thank you again Hotel Edison, we once again had a great experience .  The rooms are clean and comfortable and the staff  ... Well they are amazing.  From the moment we stepped out of our car to the moment we were checking out. Everyone was helpful and pleasant. We are already looking forward to our third visit sometime this fall. Again Thank You!",5,Tammy B,Jun-21
184,Wonderful stay,"We have celebrated our 25th wedding anniversary in NY, and our stay at the Edison Hotel has been a great success. The attention and quality of their services have been perfectly complemented on our trip.",5,Erick Chaves,Jun-21
185,Great time,"I visit the hotel Edison almost on a monthly basis,Apart of its great location next to the time square, and the renovation that was made.The most important is, the people of the hotel,From the door mans the reception and up…They all make you feel like home!!!!",5,Roy W,Jun-21
186,"Best time, best hotel, best Serivce!",Just took a girls trip to NYC and the service we received at Hotel Edison was definitely one of the highlights!! Danny and Scott went above and beyond to make sure we were taken care and even helped with reservations at a well known New York hotspot. This will 100% be the place I call home during my next trip to The Big Apple!!,5,Megan Mccullar,Jun-21
187,I love the Hotel Edison,I love the Hotel Edison - it was so great to be back after so much time away due to the pandemic.  The hotel is:Clean!  Safe! Quiet!  Friendly!  And...Room was huge and beautiful!!The location is PERFECT - especially if you are a theater fan.  It's so easy to get a subway anywhere you want to go.  Easy walk to so many great restaurants. I can't wait for my next trip!,5,Jennifer Z,Jun-21
188,"New York is BACK, Starting with Hotel Edison!!","WOW! My husband and I stayed at the Edison four nights on the 17th floor, room 1730.Totally awesome king bed, remodeled room and a great bathroom with above average shower! The Hotel is half a block from Time Square, however, the room was totally silent and dark at night time (...when you need it). During the day, the room was light due to the three windows available in the room....Loved it!.Justina at the front desk was courteous, informed and welcoming. We originally paid for a ""classic"" room ($98), but Justina informed us that for $20 extra a night, we should upgrade to the remodeled room on a a higher floor with a king bed..... She was right!The free breakfast was, whether at the restaurant on site OR the cafeteria in the corner, were exactly what we expected and it was great every morning. Since we are early birds, we did not encounter any lines or wait time ( word to the wise...).Finally, my last words are for the housekeeping... they were SUPERB. They brought us a bath robe and slippers immediately when I informed that that there was only one set in the room. The bedroom and bathroom were immaculate every night when we got back to the hotel....totally worth the extra $30 resort fee.Cheers to all the staff.....I am glad you are open and doing great business. You are true New Yorkers:)",5,Claudia Marcela,Jun-21
189,Perfect location and transfer service.,"It is right by Times Square, close enough to enjoy the city and turistic places. The rooms are small but comfortable with noise isolation. Breakfast was perfect with different options to choose (whole wheat bread, eggs, granola, yogurt, french toasts, croissant,  coffee...). I asked for a roudtrip transfer service from JFK to the hotel and the staff in charged was very helpful. Thanks to Adele who helped us with all the information we required for our roundtrip transfer service, it was perfect! Our driver Javier was very kind, waited for our delayed flight and the service was perfect.",5,Grethel C,Jun-21
190,Perfect Location with Excellent Service,"It is right by times square, down half a black so you are out of the main crowd, but close enough to enjoy it in under a minute walk. The service was excellent. everyone smiled and was helpful. the breakfast is a real meal, free, and i recommend the croissant.",5,Danielle M,Jun-21
191,Location Location Location - with Breakfast-for a low price!,The rooms are small and dark but comfortable. The staff is wonderful. Breakfast is a huge bonus. Nothing compares to the location. Less than 50 yards to the TKTS booth in Times Square. Remarkably quiet for the location. I stayed here twice in two weeks for business and then for personal travel. I will return to this gem frequently.,4,APrettyLittlePark,Jun-21
192,"Great Location, Security, and Breakfast!",The Hotel Edison is just feet away from Times Square and all that is going on in the area.  The subway is around the corner which made travelling uptown or downtown very easy.  Our room was very clean and comfortable.  The A/C was so cold we had to unplug it at times.  It was a nice relief from 90 degree weather with 86% humidity.  Security was 24/7 which made us feel safe for our entire stay (4 days).  We were given free breakfast coupons which helped kickstart our mornings.  All in all it was a terrific stay.  New York is back!,5,mgar2764,Jun-21
193,Perfect visit,Hotel was remarkable and location was perfect Dany made it worth the price for the extra mile he goes.and he was able to tell me all the sights and attractions i needed to see.Will be visiting on all my trips from now on,5,Lucy H,May-21
194,Service ���,Had a very short stay at this hotel  it was amazing . The rooms were clean and the service was impeccable. Thanks to the guy named scott and a guy danny.  Fyi their business rooms are the greatest to have meetings.felt like a executive doing mines there�,5,Valencia B,Jun-21
195,Top notch services,Visited this hotel on the day they opened back up you can tell it was some confusion but the staff didn't show it.they took care of me and my daughter's and I especially have to mention Scott and Daniel. They had the guest laughing and got them checked in.daniel the head security guy made the place fell safer on top of all the safety measures they had in place.location and services makes this place a must stay again,5,Sunny B,May-21
196,Outstanding service,I visited this hotel as a last resort because I'm a hilton honors member. But as people say everything happens for a reason. I have never been treated with as much care and comfort as the members of hotel edison treated me and my family. The security guard Danny and manager Scott made it a trip to remember. They handled ever request with urgency and they had alot of humor to go with it. I will be only going to the EDISON from now on. Me and my family thank you Danny and Scott and the entire staff at the Edison. See you soon. KURT MCINTOSH,5,Kurt Mcintosh,May-21
197,My home away from home in NYC!,The friendliest staff in NYC along with the best location for Broadway.  I never stay anywhere else. I highly recommend the Hotel Edison to my friends and family.  Been staying there for many years and will keep doing so for years to come.,5,Lisa R,Jun-21
198,My favorite place to stay in NYC!,"I have stayed here for years and stayed most recently in June 2021, and was very pleased. The room was comfortable and clean, and the complimentary breakfast was very nice with several options available. When our plans changed I felt that the reception staff were very helpful and accommodating in meeting our needs. I love the Edison and stay here when I can when I visit NYC. You can't beat the excellent location and the service is always good. The art deco styling gives you a real feel for classic New York. Convenient to Times Square, theatres, subway lines and the Port Authority.",5,Vickmeister58,Jun-21
199,My night in Edison,i had a great stay with all my friends in a room with the best view. I would like to thank Danny the manger for giving me the best stay and making sure everything was alright he is the best! i highly recommend this hotel for anyone looking to stay in times square.,5,kayla b,Jun-21
200,Great Find...,"Booked last minute and so glad we did. Hotel Edison has a great vintage Art Deco feel with comfortable rooms and great service.  We especially loved the cotton sheets, comfortable beds and no chemical laundry or air fresheners. This is a busy hotel in a very touristic location but the service was very personal and appreciated. Have to especially thank Christian, Mayra, LaToya and Scott for very helpful and friendly assistance through out our stay. We also appreciated the efficient and attentive breakfast service in the attached restaurant.",5,Sunnygirl330,Jun-21
201,That Family Feel,"I can't say enough good things about Hotel Edison. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by Danny who went above and beyond to exceed our expectations. He took really good care of my sister and I on our first stay in NYC. He made sure we were well taken care of and gave us a room upgrade (shout-out to Sam). The hotel is very clean, the staff are extremely friendly and it's a great, unique atmosphere with a historical feel. The rooms were very clean, everything was provided for us. Danny also gave us a ton of recommendations of things to do while in the city, it wasn't hard to feel right at home here. Thanks, ""Uncle Danny"" - you're the best!You won't regret booking your stay at the Edison.",5,Katelyn B,Jun-21
202,Hotel Edison,not impressed! took 30min to get checked in at 11pm. the line was long and no announcement was made like "theirs a computer issue" Their self check in kiosk didnt work either. Try and get room away from street if you go. SO loud at night. its like there is no insolation to help w/ the noise. no room service due to covid BUT they didnt tell us at desk that if we needed new towels or room cleaned/turned down we needed to ask. and when i did ask for new towels. HOURS to get and had to ask multiple people. Room itself was small w/ VERY small bathroom. location right in times square. turn a corner and see where the ball drops. also close to the big bus (aka hop on and off),3,KBM920,May-21
203,Awful Stay,"I Stayed here May 30-31, 2021 and was thankful it was just for one restless night. The lobby is gorgeous but the rooms are awful. The tub was old, dingy, and obviously repainted and someone else’s hair was left in it. The bed was like sleeping on a board. I managed about 2 hours of sleep off and on all night and was exhausted and sore all day. The view was of a bunch of roofs and AC units. The windows and blinds were filthy. It smelled musty and like weed in the hall and room. Breakfast was suppose to start at 7:30am. It was after 8 before they even opened the door leaving about a 100 of us waiting in line to get in. It was 8:20 before I was seated and another 10 minutes to even get a beverage. If you get a breakfast voucher it only covers a tiny selection of food. I opted for the eggs scrambled with bacon, toast, and potato hash. The potatoes were as disgusting as they looked, I nearly threw up. The eggs were not seasoned at all and my waitress never returned to my table so I could get salt and pepper. Because it took so long to even get my food I ended up missing my reservation at the museum ruining my plans for the entire day. I immediately found another hotel, Roommate Grace, which is way better and cost about the same and the bonus is that it has an open indoor pool. Don’t let the breakfast or the pictures of the rooms sway you because they are not as pictured. Avoid this place, much nicer locations nearby. The lobby is worth a look though with it’s Art Deco design and murals.",1,Victoria,May-21
204,A great weekend,I would like to given a great review and thumb up to the Daniel O’Obrien area director of security and Brommer to make my staying at the Hotel pleasant and safe I was traveling solo also to the staff helping me arrange my tours and directions thanks good job Edison Hotel,5,Trinidad F,Jun-21
205,"Good value & location, poor maintenance & service","Spent 2 nights at the hotel. When booking with Tripadvisor Plus the price of the room was very competitive for the Mid-town area, so I recommend it when you want to save on your visit to NYC.However, the service was not that great. The staff was kind, but the operation is poorly run. Consierge or Reception do not pick up the phone (I tried multiple times at different time of the day) and send you to voicemail, which they do not attend to either.Also, the elevators are poorly run, and outdated. The rooms are not in great shape, tapestry is torn here and there, and the doors have gaps under them. Lastly, I want to address a practice that I consider unethical and would like to warn future guests about: Upon check in you are provided with breakfast vouchers as a ""gift"". When it comes to using them, the capacity of the restaurant is not enough to serve the guests, even at times like 7-8am on a weekend! This results in a more than hour long line queuing at the lobby (without social distancing). I tried both days of my stay but had to abandon as you don't want to spend 1-2 hours of your vacation lining up. The unethical part of this is that the hotel charges you for this! After checkout I noticed a charge on my card. I returned to the hotel to ask, and they told me it was for the breakfast, which they make seem as a free voucher upon check in. They refunded this to me (of course, I didn't even have the chance to use it given the long lines) but I wonder how many of the guests have a chance to notice that they're charged. My assumption is that most guests let it go or have left when they notice the charge. It is surprising to me how a mid town hotel is imposing such a practice upon their guests to earn some additional income by handing you a gift you never asked for, and then charging your card in file. It might be an extra $30 for the hotel per night, but you will not see the guests (at least myself) return for a future stay.",3,Fivos,May-21
206,Fantastic Hotel / Danny CBrien,"This was our 1st stay at The Edison and we will be sure to have a 2nd. The signature room we stayed in was beautiful, new remodeled  and the staff were always polite and helpful, Danny CBrien  was a great person and help he was in every way he could .The hotel is literally just one minute walk to Times Square and the best bar in New York.",5,Naivi M,May-21
207,Nothing short of perfect. ,"Stayed 2 nights at the Hotel Edison. I 100 percent recommend anyone to stay there, as it was nothing short of perfect. I found the employees to be friendly, outgoing, full of smiles and desire to be helpful in any capacity. The elevator is really fast, got us to the 17th floor quickly and quietly. There is hotel security at the elevators, to ensure it's hotel guest getting on, not just anyone off the street. The room was comfortable, a good, hard working air conditioner that kept the room cool. It was quiet, never heard a sound from the hall or other rooms near. The hotel is literally within steps from Times Square...Good hotel, very well managed.",5,Jason205,May-21
208,Daniel O‘Brien,Thanks to the great job and effort by the director of Security Daniel O‘Brien I got my backpack back! Without his great work I would have a loss of +$1000. A great personality and nice person! Dankeschön for everything Danny!,5,Danijel B,May-21
209,Danny & Bobby are the best!!,"Detective Danny and Bobby helped me and my friend a lot through our time at the Edison Hotel. Both are very very good human beings who always joke around and brought a smile to our faces. These people really make you feel safe, comfortable, and happy!  Dankeschoen! ;)",5,Meander58772791466,May-21
210,Best welcome ever!,"This beautiful experience started with such a kind & heart opening welcome! Everybody was so nice & loving towards us specially DANI!! He made us feel like family & at home. The hotel is beautiful, clean & literally on time square ( best location ever!)We couldn’t ask for anything better than this.  I would definitely come here again on my next trip to NYC. And I recommend it to anyone & every one ❤️�❤️If you are planning your trip to New York this is the place to stay. Ask for Dani & you will enjoy your staying for sure!!",5,Barbie K,May-21
211,Funny and helpful staff good location in historical hotel,Booked for birthday celebration.Foeget to bring room key and ask for open room but without ID card. The security man showing a warmest greeting and make a jokes.Feel secure and not being worried about the security during stay in hotel.,4,Jill,Dec-20
212,Doorstep of Times Square,"This place is all about the location. Glamorously positioned at the doorstep of time square. The hotel is cozy and comes with a bathtub. For the location, the hotel charges a fair price and is comparatively cheaper to the other establishments nearby.",5,TravellingJerz,Jan-21
213,Good location,We stayed at the Edison during our trip to New York. We were happy with the location as it is a 1 minute walk away from times square and a subway station. The rooms a basic but I think the hotel is in the middle of being re-vamped so we were in an older room but we weren’t bothered. The rooms were clean and the cleaners came in every day. When leaving they took our bags before we left for the airport so we could explore the city before leaving. They then called a taxi for us when leaving.,4,Frankie S,Jan-20
214,Give it a miss,"Excellent location and that's the only positive thing I can say about the hotel. Hotel room was dark, drab and scruffy so was the bathroom. Worst hotel I've ever stayed in. The staff was so un helpful and the manager on shift well he's in the wrong job, no people skills, very rude and unhelpful. There's plenty of hotels in New York, I'm due to go back to New York absolutely love the city, but I definitely won't be going back there, that's a cert.",1,Ann P,Oct-19
215,Best Christmas and New Years ,"What a great family vacation and The Edison was in part a big part of making our stay amazing. Location, location, location I just can’t say how conveniently located this property is to everything. It was less than a half block from time square  and walking distance to almost everything. Also easy to find transportation and never a shortage of great restaurants around including some good street food vendors for those late nights. Oh, also the gay bars were close just in case you were wondering. All in all a great hotel to stay if you’re looking to explore New York City.  Now, staff was amazing and the beds were very comfortable. Amenities within the property were great as they have a bar and  tow restaurants with great food. We were on higher floor so could not hear any noise. We were there through New Year’s And they had a special section for guest which made out New Years experience in NYC that much more special without having to stand outside all day.  This by far is my new favorite place to stay when going to New York.  I can’t wait to go again.",5,Humberto R,Dec-19
216,Florida Girls - Spring Break,"The people at the Edison treat us like VIPs every time we visit. Most the times were in March since as a teacher that’s my vacation time. My two friends and I enjoy the wonderful 2-room suite with plenty of room. Not only are we comfortable, but we feel safe. The security ( Danny, Jahaida, and others) and staff are so helpful in telling us what to watch for and where we should go while visiting. The Wine and Cheese evenings with local musicians in the lobby is a very special touch. If our flight is delayed and we check in at 3:00 am we still feel so very welcome. The Edison has been our NYC destination since 2014. Before that we stayed at different hotels, but none of them made the wonderful impression that the Edison did and it was the very special people who work there (Scott, Rommel, Roger, De’Marcus, and many others) that made us feel like family. The location is superb, so close to the many Broadway shows.",5,PennyM,Aug-19
217,I miss my Edison family,"My visits at the Edison are among my favorite memories. I can never think of NYC without thinking of “my family” at the Edison, Scott, Danny, Rommel, Jahaida, De’Marcus, Roger and so many others. My first stay was in 2014 and I have always stayed there on every visit since. I found my NYC home. I always feel safe and loved when I am there. I hope to see everyone once it is safe to travel from Florida to NY.   Though, it may be awhile before we can actually come through the front door of the Edison and give you all big hugs, my friends and I think of you often. Getting back to the Edison is 1st on our post-COVID 19 list. Stay at the Edison, tell them Danny’s Angels sent you.",5,Paula C,Aug-19
218,Hote Staff makes the Difference,"Thank you to hotel staff Shkurte, Marcos, and Sam for going beyond and finding me a quite room , in an otherwise busy part of New York City. The hotel staff made my stay great for an otherwise okay hotel. Great location, but expensive relative to nearby hotels.",3,Marc1057,Jan-20
219,Took my money and provided no service.,"I booked this hotel for the beginning of June through Expedia.  However, they decided not to reopen until August 1'st.  I know when you book a nonrefundable booking if I can't go I'm out the money.  Apparently though, they will take your money and not refund it even if they don't provide the service because they are not open.",1,RCannon1180,Jun-20
220,Excellent location ,"We arrive at the hotel with some reservation by the reviews we’ve read here but nothing abnormal happened regarding payments or anything else that doesn’t happen in any other hotel. The room was very good, spacious, perfect, but we didn’t figured out if there were some old rooms in the lower floors. In the room there were usb recharge on the wall for the phones, so you don’t need to bring your own universal charger. If you want a mini bar you have to request one.The breakfast, in the pictures, in by menu with good options, good portions and flavors. Is in. Restaurant inside the hotel and the staff is very friendly.Inside the hotel there’s a place that sells tickets to the broadway but is cheaper to buy directly in the theaters.The three times that we’ve been in NY this was the best hotel we’ve stay.",4,MarceloMdeO,May-20
221,Awesome location!,"I’ve stayed at the Edison before and loved it so I was excited to find a decent deal to allow us to stay for our trip. The location is absolutely incredible. Steps from Times Square and broadway. We had Hamilton tickets and it was literally right out the back door. It’s also pretty close to the 49th Street station which gets you pretty much anywhere else you’d need to go in town. The room seemed to be a pretty good size and was clean. The only big negative for us was that for some reason this time they had the 46th Street door locked most of the time which was a little inconvenient. One night it was raining and we tried to come in but it was locked - we cut through the restaurant and the guy in there was really mean about it. I don’t really know why it was blocked off this time. Having that second door is a big plus. However, love this hotel. Will be back.",4,MelissaClaire93,Mar-20
222,"Tiny Terrible Room,","I popped up for a week to NYC and stayed 3 nights here and 4 at the paramount, I wanted to leave both the minute i arrived.The room was just big enough for the  bed  and the bathroom was the a joke sizefor the price this was the biggest Rip odd from NYCRooms are dated, no tea or coffee facilities, Tiny bathroomDated Rooms and Corridors dirty with room trash bags outside doors, or takeaway bags, Great location that is all its worth but i would not stay again $300 a night a rip off",1,Scott Johnson,Jul-19
223,Nice rooms (large for NYC) and great location near Time Square.,"Stayed there for quick trip with time to catch a couple of shows. Reasonably priced and large nicely appointed rooms near all the Broadway venues. Price included breakfasts, which were very good. Only issue we had was check in - room wasn't ready when we got there. Filled out forms and told to check back later. When we got back to the hotel a few hours later there was a long line and they made us wait in the line, even thought we'd already essentially checked in and only needed to get keys (and bags from bellmen). They said they were going to put in a system to dispense keys. But was a pain then.",4,fjbuck,Sep-19
224,40th Birthday Week,"I brought my husband to New York for his 40th birthday and stayed at the Hotel Edison.Check-in was nice and easy waited in line and paid for an upgraded room, however was a little bit disappointed as I had emailed hotel direct previous and asked if they could have a little surprise put in the room for my husband's 40th I was advised this would be done and if a room available free upgrade....upgrade was offered but we had to pay and no surprise in the room :(  would rather them have said they couldn't do it if it wasnt going to happen.We put a cash deposit down which was taken off each day the fees that were required.Our room had tea and coffee making facilities in which was replenished everyday, nice big bed and bathroom with toiletries again replenished everyday. Room was always kept clean by cleaners and hotel was in a perfect spot for getting around.We spent most of the week outside of the hotel so room only was perfect, been in times square we were in walking distance to most of the things we wanted to do but got the metro which was easy enough to the stuff further afield.We went to the statue of liberty, 911 memorial, empire state building, and so much more, I would end up writing so much if I said everything we did.It is quite expensive but we knew it would be so take plenty of cash!Take a good pair of walking shoes and be prepared to walk to see everything that is the best way around in my eyes. New York was an amazing experience and the hotel was perfect positioning and we had a fantastic week and have memories that will stay forever we loved it!",4,Michelle B,Mar-20
225,New York,"We stayed in the Hotel Edison in December,2019 and loved the location.  It was very convenient to shows, tours, Rockefeller Center, right at Times Square.  Great Location with restaurant and close to many restaurants.  I would definitely stay at the Hotel Edison again.",4,ronglo,Dec-19
226,"Beautiful old building, modernised well while keeping the olden days feel in parts","This is a beautiful little hotel in an amazing spot.The rooms are quite small, but they're big enough given that you'd be most of your time adventuring.I'd read that the rooms could be noisy, I heard a couple of nights of noise barely, not enough to not stay here.",5,Uncledez,Mar-20
227,"Excellent hotel, great location.","Great location, just off Times Square. This was the 2nd time we had stayed here, previous time was 2014. The room was a more modern one than previously (signature room). Free wifi, lovely bed and shower.We would stay here again next time we visit New York. Easy access to subway stations.",5,vagsteruk,May-19
228,Fantastic hotel,Stayed here with a bunch of friends for a reunion.  The front desk was amazing and the hotel was super clean.  The rooms were awesome at a great price. They had a free happy hour in the lobby with alcohol and food.  You can’t get any better with the location. It is right in the middle of Times Square. If your going to stay in the city this is the best place to be for the price. Highly recommend,5,pwheel,Feb-20
229,Suzanne in NYC,The Hotel Edison was very central right at Times Square which was great but the staff on reception was very rude every time I went which wasn’t much maybe 3 times Tex (the man on reception) was always just rude he said he was putting us in a room that had just been upgraded if it was it needed to be upgraded again it was a big room but the walls had dampness so 1 stars if that but because it was so close to Time Square I’m giving it 2 stars .,2,suzannemarshall1,Jan-20
230,The Best of the Best at Hotel Edison,"My friends and I have stayed at The Hotel Edison for the last 3 years in December. Their lobby is so large with a welcome happy hour 2 times a week with hors d'oeuvres along with entertainment. The location is perfect along with a connecting jazz club (outstanding variety of musicians) and several connecting restaurants, too. We have always felt safe, because they monitor the elevators with a security person ALL the time. From the doormen.. to the bellmen.. to the front desk...we have always received excellent service with a smile. We HIGHLY RECOMMEND for your stay in NYC to see for yourself the quality of The Hotel Edison!Special Thank you to:Rommel Gopez...guest relationsRobbie...guest relationsGio...the doorman",5,Debbie,Dec-19
231,Visit to New York with high school students,My students and I visited New York and stayed at the Edison. I've stayed here the last 5 years while bringing a small group of students to visit the International Culinary Center in Manhattan. I've never been disappointed with the service and rooms at the Edison. The last day of stay was a rainy one and we utilized the complimentary umbrellas that are provided in each room and appreciated the complimentary bottled water in each room. I'd definitely recommend the Edison hotel to anyone who wants to be close to Times Square and the Broadway shows. We purchased tickets to a show but had to be refunded due to the Coronavirus. I'm looking forward to my next trip to New York and will stay at the Edison.,5,jeffreysF3883MI,Mar-20
232,Outdated and run down,"Stayed here for 4 nights at the beginning of March for my partners 30th birthday. I contacted the hotel 4 times in total via 2 email addresses and Facebook messenger to request one of the upgraded rooms as I had seen many complaints online about the ones that hadn’t been upgraded. Upon arriving we were greeted by a rude woman. We went to our room and could barely fit the suitcase through the door. The room was disgusting, no light, filthy bathroom and smelled of marijuana. We went back downstairs and advised we would like one of the renovated rooms as asked before we arrived, we were told we would need to pay an extra $80 for one. Had I known how bad the non-renovated rooms were, I’d have never paid the amount I already had so we spoke to the manager to request another room. The manager would still not upgrade us but gave us a key to another room. This one was bigger but still not clean, we were so exhausted and upset by this point that we just accepted the room as we refused to give this hotel any more money than we already had for basic cleanliness. The hallway constantly smelled of marijuana also. Our trip was not necessarily ruined by this but I would not recommend coming to this hotel again.",1,George D,Mar-20
233,Great location but very poor decoration and standard for your money,We stayed here recently and had booked 2 rooms via booking.com We had booked this hotel for a 5 night stay and based it on its location and how it looked on their website. On checking in we couldn't hear ourselves think as they had singers and music playing in the loby I don't think is a good idea when you have guests checking in after a long flight we could hardly hear what the member of staff was telling us. Upon getting into our room we were very disappointed with the standard. Very outdated very poorly decorated and the carpet was threadbare. The bathroom looked like the original bathroom and the bath was chipped so much so we had to use a towel to stand on when we took showers. We discovered that the room safe didn't work and the numbers had been used so much you couldn't see them. Our personal items had to be stored in my families room next door. This was fixed by a member of staff who I must say was prompt and polite. There was hardly any wardrobe space for 4 people in the room and we lived out of our suitcases. Yes there was a lot of noise due to the location of the hotel and the air conditioning unit did keep us awake during the night but the location of this hotel is great and ideal for Times Square. The cleaning staff are lovely here and bed sheets were changed and towels on a regular basis. I was a little disappointed with the hotel as it isn't cheap I expected a higher standard of rooms. I wouldn't recommend this hotel unless all of the rooms have been modernised and brought up to standard you would expect. Had a great time in NYC and to be honest you are not in your room a lot anyway so we didn't let this spoil our stay.,1,Julesah74,Mar-20
234,Hotel Edison - A great location to stay in NYC,"Hotel Edison is an unbeatable hotel in NYC.  It is close to Times Square, just one block off.  Which means that it is just steps away while not having all the crowds of being right on.  Additionally, if you go to NYC for the plays, the Hotel Edison is ideally located in the heart of the district.  Lastly, being located in the Mid Town area this hotel is in a good spot to get to so many sights in NYC.  On this trip, we went to The Vessel, Hudson Yards, the World Trade Center, Brooklyn Bridge, and Harlem.But the real reason to stay at the Hotel Edison while visiting NYC is their level of service.  They are very responsive, quick to address your issues, and fast to help you guide you on your way.",5,C House,Mar-20
235,Avoid !!,"Stayed here for 6 nights with my family. Room was horrific it looks like it hadn’t been updated since the hotel opened, wallpaper hanging off the wall and a dingey carpet floor. One Small rounded mirror which was to be shared with four girls.  Bathroom door has a huge mark as if someone had punched a hole in it. Bathroom was the worse bathroom I’ve ever been in in all my years of travelling. Bath was missing loads of paint, painting on the ceiling was hanging off and just grubby, could not swing a cat in it. May as well not have had windows in the room as you could hear every single noise from outside even though we were on the 14th floor. I’m sure the hotel makes a lot of money it’s a pity they don’t invest it in the standard of their rooms. Not worth the money but location is brilliant. Only good thing about the hotel was the cleaners they were so friendly and provided us with fresh towels and bed sheets every day. Couldn’t fault them. Other hotels in the same area were fabulous looking so would recommend to shop around before settling for somewhere like the Edison.",1,Alison K,Mar-20
236,Wonderful Hotel,"Hotel Edison is a gem in the Theatre District within walking distance to most theatres, great restaurants, Times Square, Bryant Park, Central Park, etc. The rooms aren’t fancy, but are very clean and well equipped. It has an attractive lobby with interesting artwork. The restaurant is very nice and has good food and service. The room rates are reasonable. We will definitely stay there again.",5,SuzAnnapolis,Mar-20
237,Amazing hotel,Hotel Edison is an amazing place to stay. Everything is walking distance and it easy to grab a cab right in front of the hotel. The security and staff are all professional and always greet you with a smile. We can’t wait for our next vacation at Hotel Edison.,5,Francis Hernandez,Mar-20
238,A beautiful location,We stayed at Hotel Edison this past weekend and our stay was amazing. Are Carlie Arostegui Front desk manager and Scott Geres General manager are both very professional and have amazing staff who are all so friendly.

240,"Great location, excellent rates",Have stayed there several times and love the location and at some of the best rates you can find for being so close to Times Square.  Had a minor complaint on one of our visits and staff went above and beyond on our next visit to show they cared. Will definitely being staying there again.,5,Dale,Mar-20
241,Lovely hotel,"Great location, very convenient for Times square. Clean, tidy, nice decor ( except for outside which is covered in scaffolding, not much you can do about that!) Rooms are well serviced, reception staff very helpful and friendly, would stay there again.",4,Sheila O,Feb-20

To stay at Edison is like coming home.,5,Catarina,Mar-20
244,Amazing Experience at the Edison,"My wife and I and 2 children spent a wonderful night at the Edison after seeing a show.  The Edison is an iconic hotel that exudes classic NYC culture, in an authentic way. We had adjoining rooms that were recently renovated, that were spacious done with great taste and thought for the comfort of guests. The staff went out of their way to make us feel welcome.  The hotel lobby had a nice cocktail reception for guests, and is beautifully decorated with local set, in a Deco motif. The hotel's restaurant was fantastic, and didn't feel too touristy. I've stayed here before, but never with my family, and it was a great experience.",5,Catlin69,Mar-20
245,Great,"The hotel is super well located. In the middle of Times Square. Walk to Rockfeller Center, Fifh Avenue, Central Park and a lot more. Rooms are very clean and comfortable. All staff was friendly and kind. Definitely coming back on my next visit to NY.",5,Elvira N,Mar-20

248,Perfect Getaway!,"We have stayed before and we’ll be back! This hotel has the absolute best location, literally steps from Time Square. Always the most courteous staff.

249,Business trip,"Great place to stay in NYC ...safe, clean great for families. Good places to eat within the hotel. Prices extremely fair. I was more than pleasantly surprised!

253,"A+ Staff, Beautiful Historic Hotel","I’m here on tour with my chorus, and we have had the pleasure of being greeted daily by concierge staff and door holders. The hotel itself is also very charming. We love the Friedman’s and the Rum House! Breakfast at Friedman’s is an amazing way to start the day. Ending the night at the Rum House is a lovely way to wrap up! Live music, delicious drinks, and funny, kind bartenders. We arrived to a spotless room, and Kwancheewa has taken dear, dear care of us as our floor’s housekeeper. Highly recommended, especially if you get a room in her section!",5,Blessing A,Mar-20
254,Another great stay ,"We were made to feel welcome as soon as we arrived. From the doormen, check in staff and any other member of staff in the lobby area, all were friendly. A nice touch in the lobby, were the free bottles of hand sanitiser In bowls on the reception desk. Encouraging with what is happening around the world at the moment. Our room wasnt quite ready so the hotel stored our bags so we could go off and explore the city. When we later got into our room we were really pleased. Nice big room, very clean. 2 queen beds, super comfy, slept well every night. A great size walk in wardrobe with plenty of hangers and shoe shelves. Lots of draw space too. Big flat screen tv on the wall. A coffee machine with supplies and water bottles provided and replenished daily. Bathroom was really nice too, clean. It had a great double shower. Hairdryer supplied and a free safe in the wardrobe. The heating self regulated, so the room was always a nice comfortable temperature.",5,Sarah D,Feb-20
255,LOVED our stay at Hotel Edison!,My husband and I were in town for a doctor visit and stayed a few extra days to celebrate our anniversary and I am so glad we chose Hotel Edison for our stay! All the staff were so friendly and we were always greeted with a smile. The hotel was clean and housekeeping always made sure our room was stocked with clean towels and toiletries. Right at Time Square we couldn’t believe how cheap the price was! Will definitely stay here our next visit!,5,Camper647868,Feb-20
256,New York 2020,"I was concerned about the type of room we would receive after reading some of the reviews but we received a room on Floor 22 with a fantastic view of Times Square. Juan who checked us in did try and sell us the room for an extra $69 per night then $40 when we said no thank you he gave us the room upgrade anyway so thank you Juan. The room/bathroom  itself was clean,  tidy and spacious except the wardrobe doors which were very slim so we entered sideways on�We used the bar/ restaurant a few times and loved the food and drinks. Prices are generally in line with other bars we visited.The hotel ran a shuttle to the airport which was reasonabl, so I would recommend  this.A few of the desk staff were a little unhelpful at times - why would we want a kettle when we have a coffee machine.  Several requests but the kettle never materialised.Generally the hotel was ideal for us and we loved the Art Deco style.",4,Debbay62,Feb-20
257,Home Away ,"This was our fifth stay at Hotel Edison. The check in process wasn’t as smooth as usual and unfortunately we were assigned a room with an extremely noisy heating unit so we needed to change to a quiet location. We had to check out and check in again several hours later and stow our luggage which was pretty inconvenient. The front desk people I spoke with were disinterested and unhelpful at best. Then I was lucky enough to meet with ROBBY who was so kind and accommodating. Imagine our delight when we returned from our show to check into the newly assigned room only to find a wonderful and comfortable upgrade on the top floor, 22. Robby couldn’t have been more caring and gracious and is a wonderful asset to Hotel Edison. We look forward to seeing him again on our next visit!",5,MrsBicep,Feb-20
258,Weekend in NYC,"Recently stayed at the Edison Hotel celebrating my girlfriends birthday. We met the GM Scott Geres in the lobby, he greeted us with a smile and made us feel very welcomed!

Overall, we had a great stay and will be definitely coming back!",5,Heybruh,Jan-20
259,Great hotel close to Times Square,"We have stayed twice at this hotel.  It is New York City, 150 feet from Times SquareThis hotel is very old New York.  From the uniforms to the elevators it is a classic hotel.The only thing that may concern some is the price can be steep at certain of the year.  I think it is worth the money.  You are not taking cabs everywhere.  Everything you need is within a short walk of the hotel.If you have any questions I am happy to answer.",5,Regal666,Dec-19
260,Great Stay,"This was a great stay! The hotel was located right in Times Square. The rooms were quiet, clean and had everything needed.  Housekeeping was wonderful! We asked for a higher room, but had a late flight and didn't get that request. We also didn't have much of a view. However, we didn't spend much time in the room and it was perfect for our stay! Only Con: We requested a mini-fridge for $30 and received it, but it didn't keep drinks cold",5,Nina,Feb-20
261,Outstanding service,"Amazing Service by staff, specially Marcos & Carlos. Breakfast was outstanding specially the Chai tea .Everyday after a long walk had bottles of water in the room (nice touch). Thank you for ALL your above and beyond service during my stay. Will be back!",5,Wilka N,Feb-20
262,You can’t beat the location!,"I first stayed at Hotel Edison 30 years ago and then again last week for 4 nights and I am SO impressed with the renovations and updates that they have made. Location, location, location...Hotel Edison has always had the most wonderful location for theater lovers and people that want to be right in the middle of midtown. Only a 1/2 block off Times Square, we walked easily to Rockefeller Center and 5th Avenue and conveniently caught buses and subways very close to the hotel. We found the Edison employees to be friendly and helpful and I felt safe because they provide a security person that checks room keys before you are allowed on the elevator. It is not the most luxurious hotel in the city, but if you are looking for a nice, clean, friendly hotel for your family, I highly recommend Hotel Edison. (One more tip, don’t be early for check in...when they say 3:00 PM, they mean it. They will gladly hold your bags and you can go enjoy Times Square but chances are, you will not get into your room before 3:00)",5,AggieDede,Feb-20
263,Room upgrading,"We have recently come back from a 4 night stay at the Edison in New York,  on arriving we were asked straight away if we would like a upgrade to a better room at the added cost of $49 A night, I said we had not even seen the room we were booked in yet so no could we say if we needed a upgrade? I was then told I could have it for $29 a night on seeing the room which was old and nect to a generator and very noisy I decided to change it cost $29 extra per night , apparently this is something they did with a lot of people we spoke to , we were given no discount cards for the restaurant although other people were which were included in the resort tax , we  had nothing.  I found the staff unfriendly and some very rude , I would not stay here again despite it's closeness to times square.",2,Traveler832316,Feb-20
264,"Super Hotel,Staff and Atmosphere.",Everyone from the Front Desk to Housekeeping Was AMAZING. We Stayed In The PRESIDENTIAL SUITE For days Its A HUGE ROOM with lots of space.

265,Highly Recommend!!,"We stayed in The Edison during our visit to NYC for my birthday.  The hotel is beautiful and the staff is amazing.  Our room was excellent also.  And the location in the theatre district could not have been better! We saw the show Tina Turner, The Musical, and it was in the theatre just next door.",5,pmwilbourne,Feb-20
266,Amazing hotel,"This hotel has the best location in Time Square. Staff is superb, hotel is spotless. The gym was so nice, it was a great start to the day. The WiFi worked well through out the building. Will definitely stay again. 5 star experience",5,Joe,Feb-20
267,Great location but room needed decorating,"We booked our holiday with our local travel agents for 4 nights and 5 days.We arrived on Monday 17th February and departed Friday 21st.We checked in on arrival but the room was not ready at 130pm, but if we upgraded then we could have a signature room straightaway.The cost was going to be $45 a night but when I declined, it wss dropped to $30 a night, being told the room would be nicer, a better view and a coffee machine with unlimited Starbucks coffee.Personally, for $120 I felt this was expensive, so we did not take it.Instead we went off exploring and came back 2 hrs later and our room was ready.Our room was 1411 and at the front of the hotel. The view was ok- high rises but it suited us as we had not planned to be in the room much and NYC is all about the buildings and bright lights of Broadway.Everything was clean and tidy, bottled water available- 3 of us but only 2 left, but water is cheap anyway.There were enoughtoiletries in the bathroom and plenty of clean towels. There was a built in wardrobe with a few coathangers, 8 altogether, a spare hairdryer( one in the bathroom did not work) and an iron and ironing board.No coffee or tea facilities unless you bring your own.There is a Starbucks approx 50m down the road and a restaurant and bar in the hotel.Please note that there is a facility fee of $29 per night. Apparently the travel agents should be telling customers but we were not aware of this. This is standard for majority of hotels in NYC and it covers the use of their WIFI, discounts on food and other facilities.Personally, this is expensive for what you get- a cost of $116 in a room that was very tired looking and badly in need of re decoration and a new mattress on the bed nearest the window.However we had a good deal regarding price and to end on a positive note, the room was attended to everyday, beds made, bins emptied, towels changed and water and toiletries replaced.The hotel is on 46th and 47th street and right by Times Square. The location is fantastic and so easy to navigate around the city.We would stay again at Hotel Edison but hopefully in a room that has been updated and redecorated.",4,KateBrooks,Feb-20
268,Overnight in NYC for Broadway shows,We were in the city just one overnight to see two Broadway shows and the Hotel Edison was the perfect location. We used their early checkin option to get into the room in the morning prior to our matinee and the package rate that included valet parking was a great value for the city. The room was clean and felt more spacious than the typical theater district room. We would definitely return to the Hotel Edison!,5,Andrea B,Feb-20
269,Top Notch Service,"I have stayed at the Edison Hotel many times and find the staff to be most accommodating.  The rooms are newly remodeled and pristine.  The location is perfect for Manhattan.  All destinations are easily accessible.  And Friedman's restuarant is a jewel.  Great food and great prices.  Perfect for before theatre dining.  I highly recommend the Edison for all travelers, both business and pleasure.",5,Eric,Feb-20
270,Great Architecture with Wonderful Personnel,"From the moment we walked through the door, we were greeted with smiles, hellos and great conversation. The murals and architecture were spectacular . We have every amenity available at our fingertips and Time Square was right outside the door.  We will definitely be back to visit soon!",5,Kathleen D,Feb-20
271,Make sure you upgrade ,"The hotel is in a fantastic location, walking distance to all main tourist attractions, restaurants, shops and theatre. We ate breakfast at the hotel on one morning and it was excellent, with good service. The down side to this hotel was our room which was awful. There were holes in one of the doors, the window was so thin it didn’t hold out any noise or draft, the bedding had holes in it, and the bathroom was the size of a postage stamp. We had no facilities in our room for making hot drinks. There was a hair dryer on the wall in the bathroom which needed to be condemned as it was dangerous. On the plus side, the room was always clean.Please don’t be fooled by the pictures of the rooms on the website, you only get these style of rooms if you upgrade which I would highly recommend if you plan to stay here.",3,Laura T,Feb-20
272,20 year Anniversary ,"A great hotel in a great location. The staff are friendly, helpful and attentive. The rooms are clean and well decorated, with good coffee making facilities. If you going to NY for a couple of days and want to see the. sights the the Edison is perfectly positioned and at a reasonable price",5,Simon H,Feb-20
273,Suitable,"The best part about the hotel is definitely the location. The room was smaller than expected but that's probably the norm here. Everything we wanted to do on the trip was either close by, or we were close to transportation to get there. The front desk is very kind and attentive.",5,Sunshine8241,Feb-20
274,Another great stay,This was our 4th time staying here and we enjoyed it as much as always. The rooms are small but have everything you need. We also don't spend a lot of time in the room. Everyone was friendly and helpful. We also enjoy spending an evening in the attached bar. The entertainment has always been great and this trip was no exception.,4,Sandy H,Feb-20
275,Excellent all round.,"My daughter and I stayed here for 5 nights and it was great. The hotel is two minutes from Times Square and near several subway stations. Fantastic location, right in the middle of Manhattan and an ideal spot to explore from. We were upgraded to a king size as our room wasn't ready and were also given vouchers for a complimentary breakfast. Great service by all staff, friendly and welcoming. The complimentary water in the room each day was a welcome addition as well. The rooms were spotlessly clean despite the decor being a little tired and the towels are the fluffiest I've ever known! Heating/air con unit was a bit noisy but we didn't have it on constantly as the room was quite warm. The hotel seems popular with school trips, so my only suggestion would be to ask for a room not on the same floor as the school parties. We were on the third floor and the students were running up and down screaming and shouting. The teachers sat outside our room one night, probably to ensure there was no repeat of the escapades. It happened a couple of times unfortunately. I didn't mention it to the hotel as it didn't spoil our stay but I would make sure I checked if I went again.",4,Louise A,Feb-20
276,Distinctly average...,"Very central but when visiting NYC, staying in Times Square isn’t essential. I’d definitely recommend staying a little further out, just an avenue or two. Times Square was so busy in the evenings, not as bad in the mornings. The noise was extensive when in bed at night and started around 4am again, luckily we were so exhausted we were mostly able to sleep. The staff on reception were not overly friendly or helpful at all. The lobby area is very poor, hardly any seats and full of people standing around, it’s pretty cramped actually. There is a bar on site which doesn’t actually belong to the Edison, very dark and not all inviting though we did have a cocktail and a pretzel which were very good! We didn’t eat in the hotel. The rooms were very basic and could have done with a little more furniture for  belongings. Beds were comfy and clean. Water bottles supplied daily. Definitely wouldn’t stay again as I think there are better available for the cost. Wasn’t at all enticed to spend any more time in the hotel than necessary!",3,Linda C R,Feb-20
277,Family Trip,"We had a Signature family room on the 14th floor and it was brilliant. It was clean, lots of room and we would definitely stay here again. The hotel staff were very friendly and they even left us a Anniversary gift in the room when we check in, which was a lovely surprise. The hotel is close to Times Square and in walking distance to many attractions.",5,Clare M,Feb-20
278,Great Location - Too much upselling,The hotel is conveniently located in the center of Times Square.  You have quick access to the 42nd St station.  We were allowed to check in early if we upgraded to the suite.  The suite was not what one would normally refer to as a suite.  The hotel is slightly dated but overall it was a good location.,4,Natalie,Jan-20
279,I LOVE NEW YORK!!! (and Hotel Edison!!!),"I want to thank Robbi Moss for his excellent hospitality in going above and beyond during my stay at Hotel Edison during New York Fashion Week. He booked me a beautiful spacious room on the 21st floor that offered nearby breathtaking midtown city views and anticipated my every need in providing a refrigerator, microwave and an array of fruits, chocolates, snacks and libations and even surprise treats on Valentine's Day!!! This was much appreciated service!!! He was very attentive in making sure that all my needs were met during my 6 night stay, including a delicious hot brunch in Friedman's, the attached restaurant!!! I could not ask for a more welcoming and special experience provided by Robbi. Hotel Edison is fortunate to have him! The remaining hotel staff were very friendly, courteous and efficient. The Times Square location in the theatre district is a short walk, subway or cab/Uber (always available right outside of the hotel front entrance) to downtown or uptown and perfect location to experience quintessential New York!!!Caron BryanCEO : Port City Models & Talent Inc",5,Caron Bryan,Feb-20
280,Returning a forgotten item,"I would like to thank Mr. Jonathan Bracero, the Assistant Director of Security, for helping us to return a forgotten item within our hotel room.  Jonathan was more than helpful in locating our forgotten item, and helping us return it back to our home in CA.Thank you again Jonathan; we greatly appreciate your professionalism and customer service!",5,E. Jencks,Feb-20
281,Fantastic Location ,"We recently stayed at Hotel Edison for 4 nights and it cannot be faulted for location. It is a 30 second walk to Times Square and close to a lot of shows, restaurants and bars. The subway was also easily accessible from this hotel. My only fault was that we stayed on the 4th floor which meant we could hear a lot of the road works outside. The room was basic, quite cramped but cleaned everyday and had good amenities like an iron and a good hair dryer. If like me you plan on spending your days exploring, then this hotel is perfect. We were also able to check in early, and we had a late flight home and were able to store our bags for $1 each. I would definitely stay here again.",3,caoimhet94,Feb-20
282,Not the best,"We stayed at Edison hotel for a week. Our room was very disappointing, dirty carpet, smelly wardrobe and bedside cabinets , bathroom really old fashioned. Air conditioning is so noisy that would keep you up at night. When we complained to Tex at the reception, he told us that this  is the room we booked! He was very rude and unhelpful. He also wanted to charge us twice additional  fees so we ended up having  long conversations with Manager. No apologies from any of them whatsoever. I would never stay in this hotel again.",2,Beata G,Sep-19
283,Great Visit,We visited this hotel with my daughter’s school trip. Very nice old style hotel in a great location. My daughter left behind some clothes and their security team was super helpful in finding them and sending them back to us! Great service- very much appreciated.,5,Robert G,Feb-20
284,very relaxing,"Hotel Edison is very close to time sq , it a very clean hotel and very nice staff. Walking distance to many of the attraction in NY City. The sub way is in walking distance also. You have 2 very nice resturants in the hotels. plus others around. When you stay in The Edison Hotel your in walking distance to m&m world, Hersey, the ave of the Americas",5,Dave,Feb-20
285,Ok... but not great.,"This was our first visit to NYC for my partners 30th. I had hoped that as the hotel knew it was a special occasion they could facilitate a nice room. However I knew this wasnt always to be so wasnt too bothered. The location is FAB! Couldn't be closer to times square, and great for hells kitchen for eating out. The lobby is very art deco and beautiful however the staff arent great. Very surly porter, and the queues for checking in and out were ridiculous. You wait for ages! And no one could use the touch screen check in system. So no idea why it's even there. What disappointed me most was the state of the rooms. Very shabby, carpets looked dirty and needed freshening up, the walls were stained and wallpaper peeling. The bathroom was so tiny it was crazy. If you're looking for location only then this is perfect but if you're looking for something with a bit more class and aesthetically pleasing then go elsewhere. Also - four rooms were put together so close that we could hear conversations through walls! Not ideal!!",3,becmac6510,Nov-19
286,Security Staff and Assistance,A special shout-out to Keith (Security Specialist) on the lobby of the Edison Hotel. He was always a helpful member of the security team and helped us get a coffee maker and coffee in our room at my wife’s request. Keith went outside his usual security duties and  mAde sure we received our coffee maker in the room. Such a helpful attitude will assure we will always stay at the Edison during our N.Y. stays in the future!,5,Keith W,Feb-20
287,Sensational!!!!!!,"What a wonderful hotel! Complete with friendly helpful door security, reception staff even down to the cleaners ! This hotel was the best choice for our romantic getaway to NYC. We were greeted on arrival and offered an upgrade to a superior king size room for $35 a night.... well worth it!!! The beds were so comfy, rooms were tidy and to make things even better after coming back in after a morning of adventures around New York City, our room was spotless and smelt beautiful! We were on the 17th floor and able to see the flickering lights reflecting on the brickwork outside our window.. that’s really how close we were to the heart of Times Square! We slept so soundly each night and rose each morning early doors to explore. Thank you so much for an impressive stay, it was truly faultless.",5,Tonitone212,Feb-20
288,Lovely Hotel!,"Fantastic hotel, great location and such helpful staff (special shout out to Keith in security who couldn’t do enough to help us) very clean room and housekeeping staff so polite! I even left $800 dollars in our and fearing the worst thought it may have been gone but the trustworthy and honest staff shut it in the safe. Only reason this post doesn’t get a 5 star is the incredibly small room! Once you open your case you can’t move! But for how long we needed to be there, we made do! We didn’t make use of the bar there but I’ve heard great things about the rum bar and entertainment. We had shows and sports events booked so didn’t have time. We had to check out early but were able to make use of the bag storage for $1 per bag. Door staff fab, overall a very enjoyable trip!",4,Kelly J,Feb-20
289,Great Experience for our Family!,"We visited NYC for a show last week ( SIX -- Next door ) -- We had a great experience -- prices were reasonable -- they had valet parking for car -- expensive, but easy!   We stayed in a family suite which had two doubles and a king in two rooms with a shared bath -- It was Fabulous - we all had a great night sleep and felt safe and secure at the Edison! It is 1-3 blocks to EVERYTHING we did from Ellens Starlight , to our show, to Johns Pizza to times square to Schmeckery Bakery!  -- Awesome experience in all!",5,Mikie,Feb-20
290,Poor ,"I wanted to stay in Times Square as my partner hadn’t been to New York before so I wanted her to have access to everything and to be honest location wise this place is amazing. Also the restaurants are fantastic too however that’s where it finishes. The first room we were given was hurrendous, wallpaper peeling off the walls, linen marked and had a hole in, the bathroom was so worn the sink had different colours in the bowl and the smell wow let’s just say damp! I’ve never asked to move rooms in my life but I had to. When we spoke to reception they kindly found us another room and whilst in comparison to the first it was better it was still awful and the bathroom was tiny. We actually looked at booking into another hotel nearby after the first night but it was so busy the prices were extremely high. I’m not sure how the hotel gets the rating it does unless we were out in old rooms and the rest are lovely but I will never stay here again.",2,LloydHolliday,Sep-19
291,Valentine's Weekend made Perfect,"The Edison Hotel is the perfect place to stay! Located a block away from Times Square, the Edison is the ideal place to stay for anyone who is staying in NYC and looking to take in the beautiful sights of Time Square or going to see a show on or off Broadway. With plenty of shopping to do in the area, The Edison is located within a few blocks of anything you could ever need. The hotel itself is filled with the most friendly and accommodating staff who went above and beyond to meet all of our needs. My girlfriend and I had a wonderful valentines weekend and it was all thanks to the Edison Hotel. I absolutely recommend the Edison Hotel to anyone who is looking to stay in NYC.",5,Eyal K,Feb-20
292,Avoid room 430,"I'll start out by saying the location is perfect! Great walking distance and perfect for theatre district. Another positive is you can have your luggage held for $1 a bag (before or after checkout). Other than that, I'd rather stay at an, average Hilton, Fairfield, etc. Upon reservation I informed them it would be our daughter's first trip and asked for a decent room (as they take special requests). We got room 430, which was horrible. We have windows that look at walls. The heating unit banged all night the second night! I've literally had 3 hours of sleep the last night there and about 4.5 the night before. I'm not talking about a little cling/clang. I'm talking about loud banging and waking you up if you were asleep. The past night it was consistent from 1am-4am. The bathroom sink is the only thing updated and it's lacking any room to put belongings on. The bathtub is chipping away (not that I care, but I expect more for the price and for this hotel). Honestly, the price doesn't match the service received. You pay a $29 facility fee that includes your internet (but it rarely works - at least in our room). Doors are constantly slamming around our room at all hours as well (I'm sure there is something cheap to help soften that for guests comfort). I was going to do online checkout, but couldn't even do that because Bill was incorrect. They gave us a $20 food credit when we booked direct and it's not showing correctly (or at all). Positive was no issues at all adjusting bill when I checked out. I know it's NYC and everything is priced up, but it's hard to justify spending money here when you can't sleep and don't have basic accommodations that other hotels offer for $100 a night in other locations (coffee, basic breakfast or snacks, updated, wifi thar works, and no banging heating units).",3,nmarcum03,Feb-20
293,1st time New York,"Stayed at The Edison for 5 nights. 1st time in New York for both my partner and myself and this hotel was perfectly located round the corner from Times Square, all Broadway shows within walking distance, close to all bus tours and some amazing restaurants. The rooms very clean and maid service daily also irons, boards and hairdryers in the room. The safe was very easy to use. Check in and check out very quick and efficient and all staff very friendly and approachable. Would highly recommend this hotel and would book again.",5,Laura,Feb-20
294,Excellent location and very clean,"This hotel is very basic in the rooms - but believe me, you do not spend enough time in it to be bothered.The beds are firm but comfortable, but there was literally only the beds, a desk and some bedside tables.Do not let this comment detract from the fact that the room was perfect! The hotel is well maintained and very clean. This is one of the cleanest I have stayed in. The staff are very friendly and all so lovely! The only thing that spoilt our good nights sleep was other people staying in the hotel! There seemed to be a large group staying on floor 5 who thought the lift area was a lobby (and unfortunately our room was opposite the lifts) Overall, a fantastic hotel though - I can’t praise it enough especially being so close to Times Square and all the amenities!",5,lornalion,Feb-20
295,Great,"Me and my partner stayed here in December for a city break. We really enjoyed our stay here, the room was big enough for 2 of us and had everything we needed. The heating unit was too loud but we didn’t need it on and the bathroom was on the small side but this didn’t bother us. The hotel is in the perfect location and is about 1 minute from Times Square which was really convenient. The staff were friendly and security always checked you had a room key before using the lift which made us feel safe. We loved our time in NYC and would love to stay here again!",4,Rachel,Dec-19
296,"Lovely hotel,amazing location","I have just returned from a 4 night stay in Hotel Edison. It is a lovely quaint art deco hotel set right in the heart of Broadway so excellent location if you are seeing any shows. It is literally 1 minute walk from the hotel to Times Square. There is supposed to be a set fee taxi fare from JFK to central Manhattan. I don't know who sets it but our journeys to and from the hotel were $62 into NY and $75 to the airport and that wasn't including tips. On arrival at the hotel the outside was covered in scaffolding so obviously some building work going on but we never heard anything in the time we were there that disrupted us.Check in was quick and friendly. We were allocated a classic room with 2 queen beds on 12th floor (room 1219). Classic means it hasn't been refurbished. I heard someone asking at reception and I believe it is $25 per night to upgrade.The room was large with 2 beds, as we requested. The bathroom however was tiny and we didn't manage to get any hot water from the shower, always just Luke warm. The room, though dated, was spotless. The beds and pillows were so comfortable. The only down side was the ice machine was straight opposite so I was awoken a few times with people getting ice but it really wasn't an issue.Loads of places to eat within a 10 minute walk of the hotel. Perfect location for theatres. Overall a very enjoyable stay and I know I'd happily stay again if visiting NYC.",4,Wendy G,Feb-20
297,Amazing,Lovely hotel Fantastic friendly and helpful staff and perfect location  would defiantly stay here again I couldn’t fault this hotel from check in to check out everything was perfect Thankyou to you all for a  wonderdul stay in New York,5,kimcassidy3,Feb-20
298,Adele @ the tour desk,"Adele was so helpful! She got us a quick shuttle to go to the airport, and informed us of future discounts and things that she can help us with— and we didn’t even stay at this hotel! It was so kind, hospitable, and courteous of her to help and execute our wishes!",5,LL18,Feb-20
299,Great Location,"My daughter and I stay here for the New Year.  The location is great as it is very near Times Square where the program and the ball drop will take place.  The hotel has nice restaurants - Friedman’s, Bond 45 and Rum House where you can go to especially when you don’t want to brave the winter cold.  It is easy to walk or get a ride from the hotel to all the must go to places and the theaters.",5,Jane4Jayne,Jan-20
300,Grand Hotel ,Nice hotel tucked in the side street of time square. Absolutely safe and secure hotel with great customer services. Stayed here for 4 days and the rooms were very spacious and clean. The bathrooms could be a little upgraded but everything else was perfect. Nice and polite staff members  with a great breakfast menu too..,5,UD74,Feb-20
301,Solid Hotel in the middle of everything,"We always try to stay at the Edison when visiting NYC, central location, great staff free happy hour and Friedman’s on site are all great.  Some family rooms are much better than others, this time we got a so so room, but overall great experience",5,OrcaHombre,Feb-20
302,Fifthy Years Later,"We celebrated the 50th anniversary of our honeymoon at the Edison and were delightfully surprised. The staff had read our message as to why we were visiting and greeted us with a bottle of bubbly and a few other surprises. Our last visit there had been about 10 years ago, and it then seemed to have gone to seed. So we were amazed to see how much the Edison has upped its game. Our room, albeit a small single on the 17th floor, had been completly redone, new bath with tiled shower, new windows, new carpet and fixtures in the hotel's art deco style. The room was exceptionally clean, as were the hallways, which has also been recarpeted and updated in the art deco style. The front desk staff was very friendly and accommodating, although the check in process took a bit longer than it should have. Our only complaint was about those pesky daily facility fees. If you are visiting the Theater District, stay at the Edison.",5,Frank X,Jan-20
303,In the heart of Times Square,"Nice hotel right in the heart of Times Square, NYC.Unfortunately, I had booked a room with two queen-size beds but was instead given a mini studio because they were ""over-booked""! My adult daughter ended up having to sleep on the sofa bed. I had booked and paid Singapore $794.76 for two nights' stay and the hotel insisted they could only waived the US $50 service fee for the two nights' stay. Other than the above said unpleasant start to our vacation in NYC, the stay there was generally good, as was the service and breakfast offered. The tight security was especially reassuring. If you are looking for a hotel at the heart of the action in Times Square than this is the hotel for you. Great location surrounded by shops, F&B outlets, theaters, convenience stores and much much more! The subway station is also just a short walk away.",4,Peter S,Jan-20
304,Romantic Getway Wekend,"Terrific location, convenient to walking and subway.  For New York, prices were reasonable.  Room was small but comfortable and clean.  Little extras were nice, like umbrella to use in room.  Bathrooms were modern.",4,Patricia B,Feb-20
305,Double birthday celebrations ,"My husband chose this hotel when we were presented with 4 options at our travel agent for hotels in time square. I always read trip advisor before I book anything and like to always review the good and the bad . Ok so we arrived at hotel tui had put a note on our booking to let the hotel know we were celebrating our birthdays. Check in was ok , but no information given as is to where the room was or directions to getting to it. We were advised that a colleague would assist with our bags , when he did come over and asked if we wanted assistance my husband said it was ok we would manage . So he just walked away ! Got to our room , looked lovely and there was a nice package on our bed with some local information and snacks and a card with birthday wishes. Thank you.  We quickly got out and about , came back and I noticed there was a loud noise . On inspection there was an air conditioning unit below our window plus we were next to the electrical cupboard. I am very sensitive to noise and also had a migraine so didn’t help. I went to front of desk whom were helpful by given me a further 2 rooms to check . But 1 was next to a staff cupboard and slightly dated and the other onto time square so the lights and more noise . Decided to stay put we were given ear plugs to help.  I am glad we did stay in the first room as it was not to near any other guests . I would recommend that the windows in hotel are sound proofed as I felt we were sleeping with them open. Bed was comfy , I am slightly OCD when it comes to cleanliness and I did notice a lot of dust on the bedside tables and the wall above the bed . I know not a big deal but an attachment on the hoover would clean this . Daily housekeeping was done (apart from wall) . On our 3rd day I noticed pending amounts coming from my bank acc for the hotel , I was aware we had a tax charge of $200 to pay but was told by travel agent at end of the stay , so I queried the pending amounts ! Was dealt with by manager as they take these amounts every few days till it reaches the total for the stay, at no point was I made aware of this . But was efficiently dealt with and I paid it there and then rather than these amounts daily . I was assured by manager that staff should have explained this at check in. Overall we enjoyed our stay and the location of the hotel.",4,Lisa S,Feb-20
306,Karen,"Terrible room on floor 7. Window was propped up with a bible. Stains on the blind and view overlooking a yard. Moved to floor 5, not much better but not as claustrophobic as the previous one. Only stayed 2 nights but if we had stayed longer we would have upgraded. The manager or receptionist made it clear that we could pay for an upgrade but he wasn’t giving us one for free �On a positive note the reception area looks clean and the location is perfect.",3,Karen H,Feb-20
307,Great Location,"Location is great, hotel staff are friendly and welcoming. Door Stewards and hotel security are great and always checking you have your room key and how many guests are with you, safe feeling. Air conditioning is amazing (Summer) however the heating (was cold) leaves a bit to be desired as it’s very noisy. Would still return!",4,Mcgrumps,Feb-20
308,Love our Kevin Brown and Hotel Edison,Kevin Brown we is our favorite bell man. We have been coming to the hotel Edison for 17 years and we have known him that long. He treats us like family and it's so great to see him every year and hear about his family and his grand kids. We recognize many of the staff when we arrive from the door man to the bell man to the front desk people and it's so nice to see the same faces every year.... we will continue to come to the hotel Edison annually. We love the Rum House in the lobby as well as the new Bond 45 restaurant at the back of the hotel and the new lobby breakfast restaurant. Love NYC and it loves us ���,5,thatgirlz,Oct-19
309,Edison hotel,"We stayed here as a couple for 4 nightsThe hotel is on 47th street , 1 minute walk to the centre of Times Square , ideal location The hotel is Art Deco , a quick check in , bag porter took up our bags to our roomThe room small and basic , bed was high , firm mattress , very small bathroom , downside no view from the room we faced back of a building , no tea or coffee making facilities, but water was provided The room was adequate for our needs as it was just a base point for us , we would stay here again as it was bang next to Times Square , but would like to have tea coffee facilities and a decent view",4,happyfamily1107,Feb-20
310,"Several Problems, Amazed that staff could not care less!","In all fairness, I will list both the good and the bad. First the good,Amazing elevators, never any wait, screaming fastDoormen on the street are awesomeMost of the staff very helpful and courteous, Lobby is well done, Good security to protect residents, Very good in house restaurants, Endless hot water.Hotel Fails1.	HVAC roasted us at 85 degrees first three nights,  System non responsive to Thermostats       2.Doors slam incredibly loud, if left to close by themselves, come on management, buy some foam stick on dots, to pad the closing. No one wants to hear doors slamming all night long. Easy fix. Do it!       3.Maids for some reason felt compelled to leave a full size  cart right by my door, 24 hours a day. Guess what, the trash bin on the cart stinks, and I don’t want it by my door. Somebody please fix this????       4. Requested service at 1 am since the heater was about to start a fire. They sent an engineer up here who reeked of alcohol. He obviously didn’t know what he was doing based on the second engineer that was sent to our room and looked at him incredulously.  The outdoor temperature was going up and the engineering staff even told us that they had forgotten to turn off the boiler, which is why our room was so hot even though we had the air on cold and set to the lowest temp. So at 2 am, when we were ready to sleep, but couldn’t, they came up and removed the panels covering the hvac units and shut the valves that run into the unit for the heat.        5.  No one has reviewed this room for maintenance recently. Handle for tub is loose, and one side of the toilet paper holder is loose and the toilet paper falls off if you don’t carefully unroll the paper. Some grout missing in shower back wall. Scratches and wallpaper missing on parts of the wall.       6. Main room master bedroom mattress is collapsed on the edge where everyone sits down on the edge of the bed. You have to sleep in the middle to get a level surface. Come on guys, the mattress is worn out replace it.        7. bathrooms are a bit small,  be prepared.  Very hard to place personal items by the sink. Definitely only one person in there at a time.Stay away from room 1527 ! The worst part of the entire stay was when we checked out. When we informed of all the problems we had experienced at check out, the desk personnel had no empathy at all, offered no apology, nor suggested a remedy. They literally could not have cared less. Fine, I'll never go back!",3,Talltexan14,Jan-20
311,Outstanding service and location,"Travel to New York for a “white Christmas “ that did not happen but what really happen was the excellent service delivered by the Edison’ staff. We recommend this hotel for their cleanliness, room service staff attitude, specially from Lilly at 8th floor, and location. Not first time there but honestly not the last one.",5,Max C,Dec-19
312,Excellent location ,"We recently stayed at the Hotel Edison for a girls trip. This hotel is so conveniently located in Times Square, and the view from our room was amazing. The room was really large, much larger than expected for NYC.",5,Lisa R,Feb-20
313,Location,"This hotel is the best location ! A lots of people talk about how out dated rooms and noise but this hotel has been many years. They should fix a little by little without closing so I think construction sometime is acceptable. Also noise from the street is very normal because just middle of Times Square... view from rooms also impossible because of location and how many tall building there. But I think there is very very convenient from everything... restaurants, shopping, performance, also subway just right there from everything. I stayed second time here. I live in Florida but New York is the best place visit because only 2 hours to fly and very fun and a lots of things to do. From now on I will stay this hotel again and again. Location and price, service can’t beat anywhere. I and my family had a good fun time here. My children are very enjoy for cold weather ( you know florid all years around 70 - 80 even winter ) Even kids saw snow in first time in their life.!  Thank you !!",5,Kumiko T,Feb-20
314,Excellent choice,Loved our stay at the Edison. From check in to check out everything was easy breezy. I would highly recommend this hotel to anyone looking for an accommodating and safe place to stay in the city. Your literally steps away from Time Square and all the shopping and restaurants you desire. The room was better than we expected..spacious enough for four very comfortable bedding and CLEAN!! Looking forward to another visit at the Edison in the spring!!,5,Jennifer and Family,Feb-20
315,Excellent service,My husband and I stayed at the hotel just to get away for the night We loved the location and the service was excellent.  We took advantage of all the adjacent bars & restaurants.  Danny O’Brien was super helpful with everything we needed,5,Jessica C,Feb-20
316,Hotel Edison Surpasses Expectations,This hotel located in a prime location close so many major attractions greatly enhanced our stay.Our Signature room was wonderful. The staff was acommodating and friendly.The two onsite restaurants offered us aconvenient dining options with quality food and service.I highly recommend Hotel Edison for anyone coming to The City whether for work or pleasure. You wont be disappointed.,5,Kenny S,Feb-20
317,Fantastic,"Took us 50 years to return to our honeymoon hotel. Over the year we have been to 50 states and stayed in many place. New York is not cheap and rooms are smaller, we did not stay there for our 30 anniversary did appear safe. Well first book though the hotel, best rates and $20 dinner coupon and a real person from the city. Any problem with room they fix it,  show you how to work the heat in room. They are remodeling so you get what you pay for. Do not expect a remodeled room for $89 & tax. (Try motel 6)  Safety in rooms, put your valuables in the safe in the room. Great location, parties on Tuesday and Friday (5-6) in lobby, walking trips (free) from hotel or their other sister hotel. Could go on about great food in hotel, or around it, little  convenient store in the block. Have to show your room card before getting on  elevator. Have stayed in other hotel in city this beat them all in price, cleanliness, convenience, great atmosphere .",5,Harold D,Jan-20
318,Great Hotel,"We throughly enjoyed our stay with you. Great staff and nothing was too much trouble. Room was lovely and clean and kept like that every day and fully replenished with bottled water and coffee. We had a room on the 21st floor with two queen beds, very comfortable and great shower. No negatives and will definitely recommend you to others and stay with you when  we visit New York again",5,ShropshireTravelgeek,Feb-20
319,Lovely hotel,"Got stuck in NYC after my flight home was cancelled due to the storm, decided to not wait at the airport, and booked here because it was handy, right beside Times Square,Old hotel but well maintained, friendly staff, rooms bright and cheerful, breakfast was very good. Will probably look here first next time I have to come to the Big Apple.Great value for money.",4,Mick Smith,Feb-20
320,Favorite place to stay....,I have stayed at this hotel numerous times during my travels to The Big Apple.  It is in the heart of the theatre district and close to so many amazing restaurants.  The location allows you to walk anywhere in Manhattan or the subways are just steps away.  Great service - comfy rooms - and affordable when you get a deal otherwise it can be too expensive for what it offers.,5,M Jeff R,Dec-19
321,Perfect in every way,"I have stayed in probably 20 hotels in Manhattan. This time I chose the Edison for three reasons: 1) I am gluten-intolerant and have grown to love the restaurant Friedman's, which is attached to the lobby.  2.) the Edison was available and low-priced when I was searching for affordable hotels in November (for my Jan./Feb. stay,) and 3) it is an old hotel (1931) which means the rooms are most likely larger than in the antiseptic newer ""pod"" boutique hotels.I wasn't expecting anything special.  However.... the lobby is big and grand and reminiscent of the grand old hotel rooms - lots of places to sit and relax, and and one door  opens to 46th and the other to 47th. It is also situated only one block off Times Square, where the Tix Booth is, yet it is VERY quiet in the rooms. (My window looked down on the Barrymore Theater.)The reception desk employees treated me with smiles, and a sincere desire to make my stay pleasant.  There are MANY spacious elevators that arrive quickly (which has been a problem at many other hotels.) Very secure, as only guests with keys are allowed up. I personally love ""old"" hotels, and the Edison does not disappoint. It has the personality that I seek when I visit my ancestor's city. The rooms are spacious (well, you've got to look at space with NY eyes!) the bathroom has little ""cubbies"" where I can store my stuff, shower is good. The light in the room is good... and there are both optional heavy shades and light shades to pull down. The pictures on the wall were enlarged photos of old NY in different decades.) Somehow the rooms retain that grand old NY feeling, but they have obviously been remodeled many times, and are very clean and smell nice.  There was an ice machine on my (10th) floor and Starbucks coffee and several free bottles of water were left every day.A special shout out to my housekeeper, whose name I don't know, unfortunately... I am usually in NY to see shows (sons on the Broadway scene.) Some days, we simply hang out in the room all day, writing, composing and whatnot.  This could be irritating to a housekeeper... she was always all smiles and extremely accommodating (and the room was always quite clean.) She accommodated OUR weird schedule.I rented a little refrigerator from the hotel for $30 for the length of my stay, and there is a ""real"" grocery store two blocks away (""The Food Emporium"") so we could have our hummus, cheese, chocolate & chip fix while working or relaxing. (But the GF pastrami sandwiches, herbed fries and spinach artichoke dip w/tortilla chips at Friedman's are to die for!)Needless to say, it's a short walk to any B'Way Theater from the Edison. Oh... here's one more tip for you too!  No more need to Uber or taxi from the airport if you stay there.  On their website, there is a link for a van that can take you ROUND TRIP from LGA for $50! I've never left a Trip Advisor review before, but I felt like they deserve it, (and there are enough rooms that I'll still have a place if the secret gets out!)",5,Patti L,Jan-20
322,Look no further than the Edison!,"We continuously enjoy our stays at Hotel Edison.  From reception to check out, we experience beautiful and clean accommodations with many fine amenities, friendly and attentive staff, (inside as well as outside), lovely restaurants on site in the most convenient location.  Looking forward to our next getaway!",5,Sharon C,Jan-20
323,Ripped off For Additional Tip,"Went to this restaurant on recommendation of friends. Managed to get a seat almost straight away. The look of the restaurant that was very good. The food was average,  but as with all restaurants it just may have been due to what we chose. The service was okay at best. We finished our meal, paid the bill  by credit card, leaving a suitable tip. When we got home and got our credit card bill we found that an additional $5 had been taken off. This was obviously as a result of a change to the tip portion of the credit card receipt. Let’s not beat about the bush., this is straightforward theft. A shocking state of affairs, which the management of this restaurant must deal with.",1,Graley,Dec-19
324,Quick Getaway!,I’ve stayed at the Edison at least 10 times. It is by far my favorite NYC hotel. The location is incredible and the customer service is second to none. The rooms are bigger compared to other hotels in NYC. It is reasonably priced and has great amenities. I love the ambiance of the lobby-it feels like I’ve stepped back in time. I give it 10 stars!,5,Denny W,Feb-20
325,Lovely convenient hotel.,"Such a convenient hotel just a few steps away from Times Square! But at the same time peaceful enough to get a good nights sleep. Despite  a couple  of emails  our room wasnt one of the removated ones but was adequate  and reasonably clean. The carpet left a bit to be desired! Frayed in places. Anyway  our main gripe was the price of our coffee in the restaurant.  After a long flight  we really just wanted a drink and popped into their restaurant.  Charged almost 12 dollars  for two small cups of tea and coffee!!Only one each.  Even had to get the bill changed from 18dollars to 12 when we queried the price ! Back in the room I read some more reviews on the hotel and someone said you had to ask for tea and coffee  facilities in your room. So we did. Within the hour it arrived and we could  make our own tea and coffee. Why on earth they weren't in the room in the first place  I dont understand.  !!! Apart from that niggle  the security was good, the bathroom was clean and the staff were friendly  and I would  stay there again but only if they guarantee me a renovated  room .",4,Jane F,Jan-20
326,Can’t wait to go back,"Stayed this weekend and can’t say enough.From the minute we got out of our car we were wowed.Smiles. Genuine concern that our stay was going to be pleasurable.Our room 21st floor newly renovated. So comfortable from the bed to pillows and the cozy bathrobes.Had a balcony with a view of the Hudson on one side and Times Square in the other.Blackout shades bonus!Security in front so only the guests could get to the rooms.Stones throw to so many attractions.We walked everywhere. Madison Square GardenRockerfellow Center, just to name a few.Right off Broadway.Book now. Book often. Prices are fantastic.Only one set back was internet little slow. So busy you don’t even notice.Can’t wait to go back!Enjoy",5,stephanie14boston,Feb-20
327,Timeless Art Deco - Classic New York,"We recently stayed at the Edison on a quick weekend jaunt to NYC.  The hotel was built in the 30's and is a lovely example of Art Deco from that period.  Our classic queen room was small but well kept. The bathroom was tiny but pretty and clean.  Not well lit- (It would be nice if they'd put in a makeup light somewhere.) The HVAC system was electric but sounded like an old steam radiator. Huffing /Puffing / Gurgling though the night.  I chalked it up to an ancient system of pipes-and it actually served as a fairly decent white noise machine. The location is great, heart of the theater district.  We rode the subway in from LGA to 49th St (1/2 block walk from the hotel) and were able to catch MTA or walk everywhere in Manhattan. Their Edison Hour (Tues/Fridays) is a nice touch in theory. I wish it could be a more elegant event. The reality resembles a cross between an all you can eat buffet and a tailgating party.   But hey, free snacks and wine in the lobby who can complain?",4,Michelle J,Feb-20
328,Busy and fun visit to NYC,"We had two rooms reserved - 20th floor.  Totally different rooms but both equally clean and comfortable. King room had two windows with table and chairs as well as desk. Bathroom was newly remodeled and even a view toward Times Square. The 2nd room was smaller and more what you would expect - equally clean and comfortable, however, there was a connecting room in which the guests were fairly loud and bothersome during one evening.  You cannot beat the location - so close to everything and easy to navigate.  Plenty of choices for food and drink - just a little sticker shock.  Front desk staff were very kind and helpful with an early check in as well as with helping get family checked in separately. I would absolutely stay here again if visiting the city.",5,K Family,Feb-20
329,Disappointed with the hotel,We recently stayed at the Edison Hotel had 3 rooms booked in total. To say I was left a little disappointed with the hotel. I stayed in room 1422 with my teenage son. The room its self was so out dated  and small which at first I was like OK it's some where to rest our heads at night it will be fine. When we looked out our window there was a  massive building site which was unbelievably nosy from 7am so loud we couldnt even hear the TV on high volume.  The room was unbelievable cold the blinds were constantly blowing from the draft.the day before check out we book a private transfare for our party of 9 to jfk. We chose to book a private trasfare as we had young children with us. 10 mins before our transfare was due to pick us up we were approached by a member of staff to tell us there was unfortunatly a mix up and we couldn't get the private transfare even though it was Confirmed and payed for the evening  before that we had to get the other bus that was available. I wouldn't reccommend the hotel for those very reasons above also I think when we booked we should have been advised of Construction works be undertaking then maybe we could have chose a different hotel.,2,Lisa,Jan-20
330,Robbie Made this a GREAT experience!,"We were here for 4 nights which included our Anniversary, which is the same date as my husband's birthday, October 28th.  It was tough going in the beginning because we flew from the West Coast and arrived early, early with no chance of checking in until 3 pm - ugh.  BUT, then we met Robert Moss (Robbie), Guest Relations Ambassador, and he made any disappointment disappear.  He provided us lovely celebratory amenities and personally made us feel very welcomed.  His customer service was so good that we have booked a return trip for my birthday this month!  BTW, we had a room with an outside balcony looking at the lights of Times Square - rather perfect!  The hotel is lovely and has a wonderful Happy Hour a couple nights a week.  I think this will be our ""go to"" hotel in NYC from now on.  Thanks Robbie. Also thanks to Rommel Gopez and Keith in Security.  You guys rock!  Suzanne",5,Suzanne H,Oct-19
331,Second visit,"This was our second visit to the Edison.  We were first met by Juan when we checked in, he was so friendly and welcoming after such a long flight, painless check in - we were lucky to get an upgrade too - thank you.  Our room was excellent.   The location is really good - so central.  Thanks to the security staff are always so friendly on the front.  Thank you for a wonderful stay  hope to see you again",5,Deborah,Jan-20
332,Our 44th Anniversary!,My wife and I were here for our 44th anniversary. We had a wonderful time and part of that was the location of Hotel Edison but also the room and everyone who took the care to make sure we were having a great NYC experience.,5,Dan H,Jan-20
333,Wonderful staff and location,"We've stayed here several times, and will again! This is a great location, near Times Square, and you can walk to the Broadway shows. There are plenty of places to eat, shop and play for a romantic get-away, or for a family.",5,Lynda B,Jan-20
334,Broadway show getaway,"This is our third time staying at the Hotel Edison in last year.  We had the opportunity to meet Robbie who does the hospitality, in the lobby.  What a wonderful person with great knowledge of all the good places to visit while in the city.  We have come back twice since, and always let Robbie know we are returning.  He goes out of his way to make us feel like it’s our home away from home.  I honestly have never felt this any place else we have stayed, which is why I wouldn’t stay anywhere else.  Having someone who remembers you and genuinely makes you feel welcomed is rare.  Not to mention the hotel is always very clean and in the heart of the city close to all the action.  The restaurants in the hotel are fabulous too.",5,Irene,Feb-20
335,What a find!,"Recommended by a friend, we also found this beautiful hotel perfect for our two-day NYC blitz.  Friendly staff from start to finish, clean room (recently renovated) and bedding, convenient to all theatres and some great restaurants (e.g. Becco, Junior's), and reasonable rates.",5,Virginia visitors,Jan-20
336,This was a great find!,"I brought my two middle daughters (17 & 12) to NYC for a short mother/daughters trip to see a show, dinner, and sites.  After extensive searching and researching hotels in the Times Square/Broadway vicinity, we chose Hotel Edison.  It was the best choice we could have made.  Every staff member we came in contact with was very courteous and helpful. Traveling with my kids, safety is always concern and a big stressor.  I at no time while in the hotel had this worry.  I absolutely loved that there was security checking room key cards before entering the elevators. I was not hesitant or stressed about leaving my kids in the room while I ran across the street to Starbucks for a coffee fix.I also loved how centrally located the hotel is in regards to the Times Square/Broadway area.",5,Yvonne,Feb-20
337,Great Birthday! Great Hotel!,"When I travel to NYC I always stay at the Edison Hotel.  The service and staff are always on point.  If there is an issue it is fixed right away. Mr. Daniel O'Brien is always polite and friendly he goes out of his way to make sure your stay is safe and fabulous. The rooms which were just recently renovated are gorgeous, clean and comfortable.   The location is great as well. Right in the heart of Times Square near everything! If you walk out the hotel door and go to the right, you are right where the New Years Eve events happen. What I like best is the location and the friendly service I always receive when I stay here. The hotel restaurant has the best breakfast! Make sure you get the French Toast! Go below 8th street if you are looking for cheap eats. I can't wait to go back in the summer and I will be staying at the Edison once again.",5,Wheeler21213,Jan-20
338,SWEET NYC!,"Greatest stay of all time at the Hotel Edison!  Quality staff and perfectly located! Just steps from times square and minutes from central park, World famous restaurants and quick subway access to anywhere!",5,Dgallagher,Feb-20
339,Hotel Edison 4 Night Stay,This is a great hotel in an excellent location. I traveled with my 2 children aged 17 and 12 and we had a room with 2 queens on the 5th floor. This room was partially refurbished but I had no complaints at all. Cleaned daily and plenty of clean towels provided.Beds were the comfiest beds I have ever slept in during any hotel stay!,5,Juliann K,Jan-20
340,Hidden Gem,"Have stayed at the Edison several times and always pleased with the level of service and location.  Times Square is 20 yards away.  A special shoutout to manager Christian, Marco at the front desk and security teem members Kareem Turner and Derick Niblack.  Looking forward to my next stay.",5,MyRatings,Dec-19
341,In the heart of the action,"We stayed here over the Christmas period and very happy we did. With an area that is so busy the hotel made you always feel your safety was of the utmost importance. Friendly, helpful staff and comfortable rooms made this week a great stay. In a perfect location to get to everywhere. Would highly recommend. My only downside would be to bring an eye mask until blockout curtains were installed.",5,LuvabreakGeelong,Dec-19
342,Excellent...,"My friends and I had an amazing experience from start to finish. Warm greetings at the door, efficiency from the front desk, diligent security, gracious and accommodating housekeeping staff, great food and service in the cafe, heck even the guy mopping the lobby stops and speaks nicely to you!  Special thanks to Rommel for his hospitality in providing direction and assistance with a genuine smile and laughter.  We’ll be back in the spring!",5,B. Cavil,Jan-20
343,False advertising.,"We are currently staying at the the Hotel Edison and have been severely disappointed. You would think the room hadn't been decorated in the last 20+ years. The paint is flaking off the celling and the wall paper peeling off the walls. We complained about our room to reception and the response we got was ""you have been booked into a classic room, that's what they are"", however if you read the description on the website for a classic room it states that ""there's nothing standard about our classic accommodation"" We were then offered an upgrade for $40/night, after seeing the room we were offered for the extra money we decided to decline as it wasn't much better than our current room as there was damp patch on the ceiling and peeling paint, and no extra space. The rooms are small and it is a struggle for two people getting ready in the morning. The room is also cold with a heater that would keep you up at night as it's so noisey.",1,Amy F,Jan-20
344,"Vastly overrated, tired & dirty. ","Just back here from a 5 night stay with the Mrs and was completely underwhelmed by this hotel. To start, they put us into a 20ft x 20ft room that clearly should have been designated as a single room with a double bed. When we asked to be moved, we got a better room on the tenth floor with a great view & noises of the construction of a new hotel next door. Rooms haven’t been decorated in at least 20 years judging by the wallpaper coming away from the walls, mould, loose windows and poor fixture and fittings. Only pluses was this location to Times Square. Also be warned ! They hit you with a stealth tax of $25 dollars per night ! Make sure you query this with your credit card company when you get back. With the ongoing construction work to the rear, you’ve been warned to stay well clear.",1,Zorro,Jan-20
345,Hotel Edison is the Tops!,"Fantastic Art Deco Hotel literally steps from Times Square!  I stayed for five nights and enjoyed every minute.  Professional, kind and attentive staff. Great restaurants on the premisis and a Jazz Club (Rum House) that is a blast!  Clean rooms, tasteful decor.  Two thumbs up!!  I will not hesitate to stay again when my travels bring me back to New York City.  Highest recommendation.",5,Stephen J,Jan-20
346,Great Hotel with Central Location,"We have been coming to this hotel on and off for the last 15 years, because basically its 20 yards from Time Square etc, having said that the rooms are great with a modern feeling and functional TV/WiFi/Cable etc. We got a deal that included a great breakfast and remember when your in NYC a room is just for sleeping in. Thanks Edison we will be back",5,Darren M,Jan-20
347,DO NOT STAY HERE!!,"Checked into the hotel and was shocked at the state of the room. It was grubby and because of this no amount of cleaning would make it seem clean. The paint was peeling away from walls and celling. There was a hole in the wall tiles in the bathroom and you could literally see inside the wall. The room was freezing. The heater in the room was so loud it was almost vibrating off the wall. We just couldn't stay in this room so we asked to move. The next day we were given a new room, however when we got to that room, it hadn't been made up from the previous guest so we handed back the key and went out for the day, hoping that when we got back we would be provided with a room that was fit to host guests. The 3rd room was no better than the first, at this point we had moved to 3 new rooms and I just couldn't face changing again so we stayed here for the next 3 nights. This room was really cold and the heater was less noisy than in the first room but didn't give out much heat. The pain work in this room was peeling away, the covering on the heater was rusted and the paint on the bathtub was all worn away. I will upload photos, because seeing is believing. I have never stayed somewhere so horrible in my life. It was awful. I was emailed by management after I got home and had completed a survey they sent me. They offered us a free room upgrade if we ever return. However, there is no way I would ever return to this hotel!! I would not recommend it to my worst enemy.",1,chloefitz38,Dec-19
348,Perfectly located,"This Hotel is perfectly situated just off Times square. Very secure, you have to show a pass key to access the lifts.The general staff were pleasant and friendly. The desk within the reception area which we found out is not connected with the hotel, needs some service training for their staff. Not at all helpful. Check out time is 12 and the rooms are locked dead on, security have to help you with access . House keeping was good in replacing clean towels but not so good at coffee and creamer. We stayed in room 1925 and be aware an ice machine is located next to it, which frightened the life out of me when we heard it in the early hours. Didnt eat here as so much choice outside. Wifi was intermittent",4,Hollysnanny,Jan-20
349,"Excellent location, friendly & accommodating staff","My family of 5 stayed in a family suite at the Hotel Edison. We walked every where we went, the staff answered all our questions and were both very accommodating and friendly to my small children which is sometimes hard to come by. We will stay here again when we visit NYC.",5,Valerie S,Jan-20
350,Jan-20,Just back from our stay here the hotel is on a perfect location and the staff are all extremely friendly and helpful. The restaurants were amazing and we loved the food. The room was very dated I have read here that the hotel in undergoing renovations so I'm assuming we were in the old rooms! The room was cleaned everyday and fresh towels daily I couldn't fault this hotel if I were to come back I'd try upgrade to a more modern room.,4,Eve,Jan-20
351,Right in Times Square!,"Right in Times Square! It is walking distance to everything. There was 9 of us and we got three rooms. The hotel is small but for the price we paid using Expedia, it didn’t matter. Staff are very friendly. When we first arrived, their server was down so we couldn’t check in for another two hours. I would stay there again if I could get the same deal as I got on Expedia but I would not pay more for the hotel.",3,Tin,Jan-20
352,"Good location, simple rooms.",Stayed as part of a package with BA. Had a standard room on the 15th floor. Room was small and was in need of updating. I don't expect complete silence but there was alot of noise from outside most of the night. Staff were friendly enough but OK is as good as it's gets to me.,3,Stevetav,Jan-20
353,Exceptional Stay,"As always, we loved our time at Hotel Edison.  Greeted warmly by Bobby at the door along with Franklin, GO and all the others at the door.  We had a great room (kept by the wonderful Rose Charles), a great experience at check in and check out, treated like family by all the staff and taken care of by Bell Captain Larry, Charles, Kevin, Tommy and all the bellmen for all our needs.  The hotel was pristine clean and well maintained.  We had a great lunch at Friedman’s and hope to try Bond 45 on our next visit.  It was another great experience for us, and we can’t wait for our next visit.",5,Cathy,Dec-19
354,Christmas in New York,This hotel was not all it is said to be. My family of 4 had a balcony suite on the 21 floor. The night we checked in the front desk clerk informed us that our room was given to another guest due to over booking. We informed her we had booked this hotel in June of this year and we were not very happy. She and the manager told us that they would put us in a different suite they was exactly the same just the balcony was unavailable due to construction. The suite they put us in was very small the heat/ air only worked in the main bed room and not in the living area. Also the room was beyond SMALL not ok for a family of 4. The next night they put us in another room that was a bit larger the heat still didn’t work in that room they had a space heater for the living area. The bathroom doors in the rooms were hideaway doors and did not stay shut. The two restaurants in the hotel were very over priced and horrible. We over payed by hundreds of dollars for this hotel and will not be staying again. I would not suggest eating at the restaurant either.,3,Mar,Dec-19
355,Very central ,Loved this hotel. The rooms were dated but very clean and very spacious. Didn’t bother us as we didn’t spend much time at the hotel. We didn’t eat here so can’t comment on the food. The door staff were very friendly and helpful. Very central. Highly recommend,5,Blondieirishgirl,May-19
356,Rude staff,"We Stayed here for 3 nights. Upon arrival we had a young man that checked us in. Wow his customer services was outstanding ( NOT ) no hello how are you welcome etc. All he said was name and credit card, there was a slight problem with my card and he was like u can’t check in until u get it sorted. After travelling for well over 12 hours and having a long flight this was not what I  was expecting. I at least wanted a warm welcome it would have made it all the more better and as for the resort fee $83 for 3 nights so I could use a gym ( that was not even on site ) two bottles of water in my room everyday.ROOM room was of average standard very little storage bathroom was like a sauna with the rest of the room being cold and when u turn on the heating it was loud with a banging noise. CHECK OUT Was greeted with a hello and was asked for ID, I did not have my passport on me as I had left it with my husband. I was rudely told that I should keep my passport on me at all times as it’s the LAW. Because if anything was to happen to me how would the police know who I am. It was told to me in such a manner I felt like I was a naughty school boy (last time I checked I was not). !",1,Ronan G,Jan-20
357,Holiday,"Absolutely discussing cockroaches terrible damp ,manager was rude and vile, bathroon had smashed tiles broke mirror ,hole in the window frame and would have got more sleep in Time Square it was so noisy, we had 2 rooms and both were not fit for rats",1,V******,Nov-19
358,Mid week getaway,"In the city for dinner and a play, The hotel Edison was the prefect pick. Conveniently in the middle of everything, clean updated rooms with very freindly & helpful staff. We will be booking again, hopfuly soon. A special thanks to Eric B. for all his help in making the night enjoyable.",4,yatauro,Jan-20
359,Edison Gets Even Better,"Have stayed at the Edison for years, but the restoration of Art Deco in the hotel and upgrade of rooms is  great.  They can't change the room sizes, but have made them  lovely and especially appreciate the new windows and heating/cooling.  Staff always friendly, but even more so on my last trip.  Enjoyed free Happy Hour with terrific musicians. Can't beat the location of the Hotel Edison for theater and restaurants!",5,kathy M,Jan-20
360,Awful room and very rude staff!!,"checked into this hotel on Friday 17th jan and dumped suitcases in room on 6th floor (very dated) at 4pm... arrived back at 8pm and this is when we noticed the state of the bath in our bathroom! The blind was paper thin and window was taped where it was cracked!!! We turned the heater on as it was up to minus 8 when we were in New York, only to be faced with the loudest heater I have ever heard! What can only be described as a tumble dryer with metal balls inside of it!! Went down to reception to complain about this, a very rude woman bluntly asked why I was only complaining now after 4 hours? I explained we had literally dumped cases and straight out to explore.. she offered me a different room on the 12th floor and luckily I checked it out before moving my luggage ... it was less than half the size of the room I was currently in and the bath was exactly the same, disgusting!! All staff we encountered were RUDE RUDE RUDE!!!!",1,Georgia K,Jan-20
361,Mother-Daughter Get Away,"Very nice, older hotel. Clean and close to Times Square.  No breakfast and check-in was incredibly annoying (Jennifer would not check me in because the reservation was under my husband’s name).  Other than those two annoyances, this bargain hotel is beautiful with solid wood finishings.",4,April,Jan-20
362,Great experience!,"Room was very clean, hotel staff was wonderful... very kind and accommodating, maid service was excellent. Location was awesome!! centrally located to everything.  Had no issues booking, during our stay, or checking out. Hotel was on top of it. Loved it, would stay again!",5,Sara,Jan-20
363,Great value in the heart of the city!,"We chose Hotel Edison precisely because it was so close to the theaters and restaurants we wanted to visit on this trip to NYC and they did not disappoint. Easy check-in, comfortable room, a great lobby area to enjoy. All staff members were gracious and helpful even though the Hotel is always very busy.",5,Pat N,Jan-20
364,Excellent Edison,"The Edison Hotel has been my faavorite choice for over 30 years, They have always liistened to my requests. Because I do not appreciate traffic noise while trying to sleep, the front desk persons recommend rooms that defer the noise. Also i am impressed with the security measure: requiring guests to produce room key before entering elevators which are readily available. The people who clean the rooms are very accomodating and friendly. Having two restaurants on site helps when the weather is bad or when a quick breakfast is needed. Finally, the location is perfect to see mant theaters that are very near and the TIX Booth is two minutes from the front door. I hope the reader of this review can understand why I call it Excellent Edison.",5,53449LarryC,Jan-20
365,"Fun is close by, sleep is phenomenal!","This location allows you to enjoy all the fun near Times Square: Broadway, great restaurants and clubs, and never be far away from a hot, high pressure shower, extremely comfy beds and attentive staff. Oh yeah, all this comes with a very reasonable price too!",5,MelD,Jan-20
366,Sweet 16 Birthday Trip,"We stayed at the Hotel Edison for my daughters 16th birthday get away, we were given VIP treatment throughout our stay. The hotel is in the heart of Times Square and is in perfect location for anyone wanting to take in the sights of the city. The hotel and staff were very accommodating and helpful, we will definitely be returning!",5,Sue F,Jan-20
367,Disappointed,Looking on website and saw lovely bedrooms we booked two rooms for our stay. Arrived today and ours is a disappointment especially the view of a building site down below and they are a little tired looking.Good location however but the pictures on website don't live up to your expectations.,2,Karen,Jan-20
368,"Meh, just meh....","This hotel is just ok, nothing special or remarkable about it. Maybe back in its heyday it was beautiful but now it's very dated. Some staff were extremely pleasant, some were functional. On booking with a travel agent we were told breakfast was included but on our arrival we were told it was only for 2 of us, not my child. Nothing was explained as to the reason and as we hadn't paid for it, felt unable to argue. The check-in wasnt exactly a warm friendly welcome, came across as more regimented and cold.The room we had on the 15th floor was dated and tired looking. The heater was extremely loud which meant we couldn't use it through the night and gave us a very chilly room in the morning! The room was clean and well appointed. Bedding and towels nice and fresh. The beds were comfy and we slept well after a day of walking. We were situated over 47th street and it was noisy, didn't bother myself or child but my husband struggled a little.The cleaners and security staff were always friendly. I didn't mind showing my room key to access the lifts from the lobby, just made me feel safe. Breakfast in Friedman's was ok for me but my husband and kid loved it. The Rum Bar was a little busy at night due to the theater across the road but the bar staff were pleasant and attentive.Over all the hotel was a place to lay our heads after busy days sightseeing and shopping and for that the location was excellent. Would I book this hotel again.........definitely not as theres nothing special about it and I certainly dont appreciate paying for ""amenities and facilities"" that do not in any way shape or form exist.As for the City That Never Sleeps.........you were amazing and we will be back.",3,Michelle D,Jan-20
369,Decent Hotel,"We came to NYC for a week and stayed at the Edison, nice hotel and perfectly situated in Times Square.Rooms are ok, nothing flash but for us it was only a base for sleeping and washing ! The rooms need better lighting though as it was very dark all the time. The heater on the wall was extremely noisy too, but all in all not a bad hotel to visit !",3,SiLydDon,Jan-20
370,Convenient for Broadway Patrons but Disappointing,"We loved the convenience of rolling right out of the theater at 11pm and across the street to the hotel (though they'd closed that entrance so we had to walk a couple of blocks around to the other side). However, the location, ironically, wound up coming back to haunt us a bit, as the noise from Times Square woke us up at 1:30 a.m. (sirens, drunken revelry, etc.) Our heating unit was also very loud, contributing to a lack of good sleep. Also disappointing here: 1) The ""free wifi"" connection did not work once during our 24-hour stay on any of our devices; 2) We arrived 1.5 hours early, waited in a short line for early check-in and were told our room wasn't ready but were pre-registered, only to be told upon our return, later, to get back in the end of the massive check-in line; and 3) We were charged a dollar a bag to keep our bags for us until our rooms were ready. Avoid this hotel unless you don't care about wifi, sleep extremely soundly, and are planning to arrive after check-in time!",3,Chris Heim,Jan-20
371,great location,"Decent value, very clean and the bed was comfortable, but bathroom was very small.  Some of the staff were less than friendly.  Location near Times Square and the theater district was excellent. Also easy access to subway so you can get around the City easily.",3,davesview2,Jan-20
372,"Location, location, location...","Stayed at the Edison for one night (Saturday) during a long holiday weekend.  We booked the reservation a few months in advance as we also had tickets to see a Broadway show that evening.  Price was reasonable -- especially for the location - just off Times Square.  The staff was very accommodating and helpful.  We had one meal (at the bar) at one of the hotels on premise.  Later in the evening had a night cap at the other restaurant where they had live music and good ambiance.  Our room was on the 12th floor.  Plenty of elevators to shuttle guests.  Security present all the time so always felt secure. Rooms were ""dated"" and need some sprucing up... but considering the price, understandable.  Overall room was clean. Bed was a King -- solid, firm - made for a good nights sleep.  We drove to NYC and used their Valet to take care of overnight parking.  $60 for parking -- expensive but guessing worth it saving me the hassle of trying to find something cheaper.  Overall, comfortable stay in a central location at a fair price.",3,Jeffrey G,Jan-20
373,Perfect for travelor's who will attend the theater,"This classic hotel may be the best option if your travel plans include attending Broadway plays.  The hotel is on 47th St. right off Broadway in the Times Square area but also has an exit onto 46th St.  Then there is a shortcut to 45th St.  On these three streets, there are around 8 theaters with some of the most popular shows.  Pros:  Price, location, newly renovated rooms with enough space to move around, travel desk for tickets for  airports shuttles, plays, tours, etc.  Three restaurants (one gluten free) within the building, cleaning ladies are extremely accommodating.  Many other eating options nearby with lower prices. Cons:  Bathrooms are small but adequate, street noises in rooms on 47th St. can be loud, crowded lobby with only a small sitting.",4,Loucie,Jan-20
374,Avoid!,"I booked this hotel with free cancellation. The property deducted £255.70. When asked why they said it was to ensure i had been using a valid card... fair enough. I had to cancel my trip. So, instead of reimbursing my money they already took, 1 week later there were 2 other payments taken. The first for £257.02 & the second for £233.93? The property has yet to get back to me on why this has happened. My credit card is now over my limit for which i will be charged. I am absolutely disgusted. The fact that each amount is different is very odd to me. Scammers, AVOID",1,Alison M,Jan-20
375,"Perfectly placed, Brilliant Stay","I stayed here from 13th-17th January in one of the renovated suites with a terrace view. I can say from check in to check out all the staff were wonderful, friendly and polite. I liked the security that only allowed access to the lifts towards the rooms when you present your room key - always a friendly greeting available! The room was perfect, very good housekeeping kept the room clean for us and we found all staff helpful when asking for directions or tips. With Times Square only being a few steps away this is the ideal location for tourists. We have to give big props to the doormen, both that we saw were very friendly, welcoming and we had read many positive reviews about them before we came to stay here; now I can see why. They are a credit to your hotel. Will definitely stay here again! Thank you for adding to a wonderful week away.",5,jessicadX4438HZ,Jan-20
376,Great stay!,"Excellent location, helpful and friendly staff, great bar attached to the hotel!  I was upgraded to a signature king room based on my booking.com status and it was a big room.  The bathroom was nicely updated too.",5,Barbara R,Jan-20
377,Mother daughter trip,"My daughter and I recently stayed at the Hotel Edison in Times Square New York. While visiting, my daughter became ill and needed to heat her soup which, we purchased in china town. While the room did not have a microwave Justina, the wonderful associate who, checked us in, sent a microwave to our room. That is what I call going above and beyond. We did have a small issue with our accommodations and the hotel reached out to us to remedy any issues we had with the room. Again Justina was right on top of it. She moved us from our first room and upgraded us to a very nice room with very comfortable beds and a remodeled bathroom. I am so very pleased with the outstanding service we received from everyone staffed at the Hotel Edison. I will definitely be recommending it to anyone looking to visit the Times Square area. Thank you Justina for being an exemplary representative of the hotel!!!!!",5,S.Parker,Jan-20
378,Superb location ,We spent one night here to see a Broadway show. What a superb location. Directly across the road from Hamilton. A 2 min walk to Times Square. It was built in 1931 so still maintains some of its Art Deco charm. Our room was old but just fine. There is currently building going on next day that will wake you early. But apart from that it is the perfect NY hotel. Good breakfast at Friedman’s. Nice to have vigilant security at night as well. Made us feel safe.,5,Deanne D,Jan-20
379,Excellent location and service,"We stayed in a Classic Junior Suite at the Hotel Edison to celebrate our 20th anniversary. After reading reviews, I was worried that ""classic"" meant ""old"". We were pleasantly surprised to get a beautiful, spacious, and renovated room. They even gave us an anniversary gift bag full of cookies, chocolates, and snacks along with a card and balloon. Check in and out was quick and easy. We enjoyed the evening reception on Friday night - good snacks and nice music. Amazing location - so close to the theaters. We will stay there again.",5,NancyD,Jan-20
380,Love the Edison!,The Edison is a delightful place to stay and the staff is very helpful and caring. Great location for theatre going and many great restaurants in the area. Friedman's is now delivering room service!  A plus!!!,5,John S,Jan-20
381,Hotel Edison Times Square,"we have had a fabulous stay at the Edison in Time Square, NY NY.  The staff goes out of their way to make sure we have had a good stay.  The location is located so close to Broadway we are able to walk there, walk to dinner, walk to shows, even a local laundry  store.  If you want a special visit with old school flair, history, and a staff that takes your visit and security serious; Hotel Edison is the place.  Both restaurants are excellent and open for Breakfast early and dinner late at night.  The beds are really comfortable and the small suite is pretty spacious.  As I write this review we are looking out the window  love looking broadway.",4,ken,Jan-20
382,Excellent locatio but thats about it!,"The only good thing about this hotel is the location. We were put in a dark, dingy old fashioned room, nothing like advertised on the website. We actually asked to move to a better room and were put in one with two double beds instead of two singles. not an improvement to be honest , the mattress was ruined with a big dip in the middle. Odd and broken bits of furniture and just completely dated.The door staff and bag check staff were lovely but the check in staff on reception were just rude to be honest.At the end of the day it was a (lumpy) bed to sleep in and the room attendants did a great job of keeping the rooms clean (making the most of a bad situation).",3,aboyla,Jan-20
383,First visit to New York and the Hotel Edison,Great hotel with friendly and helpful staff.  Close to places of interest.  Very close to TImes Square.  Room was very clean and comfortable.  Restaurant served good food.  Would definitely go again and recommend!,5,Ann G,Nov-19
384,The Edison is a hidden gem!,"I have been staying at the Hotel Edison over the past 50 years.  This hotel has the best location for Broadway show patrons.  We walked across the street on 46th and 47th, and even just next door, to see several plays.   Or across the street and through a pedestrian walkway to get to shows on 45th and 44th.  The staff is friendly, the room was clean (great housekeeping staff), with a comfortable bed and top quality bedding.  The bathroom is updated, with plenty of hot water on demand. The restaurants located off the lobby have great food.",5,Sarah B,Jan-20
385,Love The Edison!,"Been a guest there for several years and when wanting the downtown experience, it's where I stay. On my last visit the staff upgraded me to a mini suite with a balcony and it was snowing! Rooms are adequate in size, clean and hotel security is top notch. All this, plus The Rum Room downstairs with live jazz pretty much every night. The staff always treats me well and the concierge is a delight. Try it--you'll like it.",5,Michael C,May-19
386,Amazing staff!,"Have never stayed at the Edison before.  Was a bit Leary of a new hotel being a creature of habit and knowing everyone at my usual spot!  Let me tell you!  The staff here is beyond kind.  From the moment we checked in with Sami, Laura gave us all the information we needed, Alana, Frances and Joe at security are not only right on top of security but have a great sense of humor and always have a smile on.  But most of all Reinaldo our room lady!  I use room lady and not housekeeper because she doesn’t keep my house but she was such a nice lady!  So polite, so kind - understood completely that we recycle and did not want service to change everything everyday.  She truly made the trip.  ( a few months ago we had a theft incident in Seattle and my luggage was also stolen- we are a bit  more paranoid now!). I had no issues with Reiny.  Such a sweet attitude!  We are moving rooms on Friday as our youngest is coming to visit us for 2 days.  I don’t want to change rooms and lose Reiny.  Thank you hotel Edison - and we still have until Sunday!  It is also located so well!  And the new reconstruction is beautiful!",4,Climber30529,Jan-20
387,New York Trip,My family and I stayed at the hotel Edison in dec of 2019 and had a great experience. Melissa at the front desk was especially helpful!! She made our stay so easy and made it feel like we were at home! The ease of the location was awesome too. We would definitely stay there again.,5,Miranda S,Dec-19
388,I tried to like it,This art deco hotel has lots of history and even hosted a scene from 'The Godfather' but it needs a shake up. Our room was pokey with a tiny bathroom and only had one bedside table and lamp. When i asked for a table and lamp they initially brought a lamp and put it on the floor? I asked again and didn't get a table but a standard lamp instead. they also (along with many other hotels charge a resort tax of 29$ a night.,3,Dean L,Jan-20
389,Great stay,"This was an overnight stay for me and my husband at the hotel we're celebrating our anniversary. We wanted to stay close to the theater where we were attending a Broadway show. Check in was fast everyone was professional. Our room was clean well lighted everything you need was there. The security was their promptly to give us access to our room terrace. Bed was comfortable, breakfast in the morning was amazing. We'll diffently be back. Thank you hotel Edison.",4,Mrs. Gordon Brown,Jan-20
390,Excellent all round,Hotel was fantastic. In amazing location. Room was gorgeous and spacious. Staff very happy and so helpful. The hotel even brought my daughter a happy birthday gift for her 16th birthday. Would recommend highly.,5,Sally-Ann R,Jan-20
391,Misleading information,"Stay away from this hotel, on arrival I was told to give them a credit card as I had to pay a fee of $172.14, I was not told this when I booked,I asked what it was for, and was told it was for the use of facilities like water, internet, newspaper & gym, I didn’t use any of these facilities but still had to pay for them, I then found out you are not legally required to pay the fee when I approached them about this they didn’t want to know and took the fee anyway. It says hotel was refurbished in 2016 this is untrue, I stayed in room 1420 and it wasn’t refurbished neither was the rooms other family members stayed in, ours had the windows nailed shut and draughts coming in from every angle of them, the bathroom was old, in very bad need of a make over, the only people who do a good job in this hotel are the cleaners who work very hard every day, the check in staff are so ignorant, I would never stay in this hotel again as they give to much misleading information.",1,66siobhan321,Jan-20
392,One to definitely consider,"Great hospitality, great service. Nothing bad to say and no complaints. Many great memories and plenty more to spend. There is obviously many hotels in the lively city of New York but this one stands out from there simple hotel name and great logo they will do none other then provide you with service that makes you feel at home and even in paradise away from home.",5,Caroline M,Jan-20
393,Great trip,"Stayed at the Hotel Edison as a part of a package deal through travel zoo. it was a wonderful experience. The hotel is older and the rooms were small, but they were clean. everyone who worked there was very friendly and helpful. they went out of their way to make things nice for us. the location was great. right off of times square. I would definitely want to stay there again if we ever get a chance to go back.",5,mleksmom,Jan-20
394,Fantastically located hotel ,Stayed here this month for 4 nights. On arrival we were booked in really quickly and given a room on the tenth floor. Two double beds in one room. Large room with not much lighting but clean and beds were comfortable. Unsure if the room has recently been refurbished but the bathroom definitely hadn’t! It was small and dark and old fashioned but it was clean! Could hear Times Square when in the room but wasn’t overly loud. Room tax was $114 for the 4 nights. WiFi included and 2 bottles of water left everyday. I would stay here again if I ever visit NYC again due to the fantastic location and comfy bed!,4,ajays30,Jan-20
395,Efficiency in motion.,"The hotel staff is top notch. Our concierge, Robbi made the experience personal and flawless. All staff was notably top of class.  The room with a terrace was well equipped with two spacious closets, robes, ample lighting.  Thank you!!",5,adam l,Jan-20
396,Male,"Jenny the assistant  manager was excellent  after our  room was not available on the first night, Tex the man that checked us in was the worst customer service person we have come across, thank God for Jenny, the upgrade  was so good.",5,Bradley G,Jan-20
397,"Great location, in need of make over. ","Hotel is in a perfection location, having stayed on Times Square before at the W I liked this location. This time we thought we would give the Edison a try, on entering the hotel the staff where extremely friendly & helpful and hotel looked great. When we went to our room, we found a good big sized room with comfortable beds. The rooms where poorly lighted though and need of serious modernisation. The bathroom was seriously dated and look dirty although it was clean. I really hope they modernise this hotel as it’s in a great location and has a lot of potential.",3,Stephen-Swift,Jan-20
398,Not for NYE -New Year’s Eve,I booked a stay for New Year’s Eve NYE in New York City to watch the ball drop when I called I was told that not all rooms can see it but most Canafter booking I looked at all the reviews and it turns out -that hotels location is NOT in viewing distance of the ball drop Apparently you can walk down the road and try and squish in with the rest of the crowd but not have access to use the bathroom Etc in the hotel and come and go So what are they selling? It is legitimately a hotel close to where the ball drops that is it nothing more there’s a lot cheaper hotels in the area for thatwe never went and we lost our room full price of almost $1000! It was a bait and switch scheme they tell you one thing and deliver another they cover themselves by saying there’s no refunds -even though I tried to refund it that same day! What hotel won’t give you a refund two months before your stay?? Don’t be fooled by their lies read all the reviews First I don’t know if it’s a nice hotel but it’s certainly not the place to view the ball dropAnd their customer service is atrociousI’ve stayed in many hotels and have had to switch plans numerous times without any problemsI guess what can you expect from a hotel in New York City that is trying to dupe tourists?,1,Coba,Jan-20
399,Good location but...,"I stayed at Hotel Edison for nearly 30 nights on a business trip.The main reason I chose this hotel was the location, in easy walking distance from my work mission.I found the hotel to be dated which was the main drawback in my opinion, but the friendly staff helped make my stay nicer.The most annoying part of my stay was that I was surprised one day on getting back in the evening with having to go to the reception because my key did not work anymore; only to find that I had to change room for a reason I still ignore.After spending that evening moving rooms, I found out that the door did not close properly behind and had to wait for days (going back to chase several times) to be given a new room (and again spending quite some time moving a lot of things).I have to say after all the trouble and given that I stayed there for about a month, I was very disappointed not to get any sort of compensation.",3,CedricDamourParis,Nov-19
400,Not the right place,"Went with a group.  Hotel staff, especially security were rude.  Made us stand around in the lobby for an hour while they put our bags away.  The lobby wa extremely HOT and crowded everytime we passed through. They did not have all our rooms ready as promised.  Fortunately we got all our rooms, another group did not.  Room was ok.  AC did not work properly.  The bathroom is very small.  The hotel is in a great location, but the staff that we encountered ruined any of the good points.  Stay somewhere else.",1,Beverly M,Dec-19
401,Affordable stay in a great location,We were in NYC to see David Byrne's American Utopia.  The hotel Edison is in the ideal location for a visit to NYC.  You are in walking distance of many sites.  The room was very clean and the mattress comfortable.  We were on the 5th floor and the room was extremely quiet.  I'm a light sleeper and didn't hear the normal sounds of the city.  the staff was courteous.  Entrance to the elevators was monitored to insure on hotel guests were admitted.  This added a sense of security to my stay.  I highly recommend this hotel for a visit to NYC.,5,ybrlabs,Jan-20
402,Great location,"I was in NYC to see Hamilton and this hotel is directly across the street from the theater.  Room was adequate, quiet and clean. The staff was friendly and accommodation.  We were able to leave out luggage at the hotel after checking out. The onsite restaurant has a great breakfast.",4,sftraveler823,Jan-20
403,Miss s page,"Really disappointed in this hotel, check in staff looked down his nose at us quite rude when asked questions on room tax. He clearly had no customer service skills at all maybe if I was rich his attitude might of changed towards me. The room was grubby with no light only 3 lamps carpet was rugged around edges of the room. Our view was a brick wall and we had a Noisy generator outside our window making sure we got very little sleep during our stay. We asked to be moved only to be sneered at and shown a room much worse ( grubby) then our original room. NOT IMPRESSED AT ALLProbably the worse hotel I have ever stayed in!!",1,Sarah P,Jan-20
404,Lovely hotel,"Lovely hotel, rooms basic but clean and spacious. Reception staff not that friendly. Help dedk very good. Restaurant expensive but very nice, excellent staff. Hotel lobby lovely in December, very xmassy. We went yo the welcome night, lovely buffet and free wine.",5,hamishpatty,Dec-19
405,Perfect Stay!!,"Just took my mom to NYC to see a couple of Broadway shows. Found Hotel Edison online due to the location to the theaters. Can’t say enough great things about our stay! Location was fantastic. We could walk to Times Square, Rockefeller Center, the tour bus and so many theaters and restaurants. The staff was so nice from beginning to end. In fact we even commented during our stay how nice and helpful everyone was. Even the cleaning staff spoke to us and did a great job. The room was clean and comfortable. The bed was super comfortable. The hotel and our room was very quiet. I highly recommend staying at Hotel Edison. I will definitely stay here again!",5,OkieTX,Jan-20
406,New Year Trip,"The Trip was booked through a travel agent, and we were really looking forward to it. We new it would be busy, but expected a Hotel in Times Squqre to be able to cope.The reception staff were curt and rude, unhelpful and ignorant.The hotel is in desperate need of some attention, and if you are given room 739, ask for an immediate replacement !! We reported a radiator that sounded like it was going to explode on 2 occasions, and nothing was done, and no feedback. We had to just unplug it in the end.The light in the room is either a table lamp, or a bathroom light that lights up like a floodlight, with no option to turn it down.The bin wasn't emptied for 3 days, we got a knock on the door at 10.30 at night to ask if we wanted the room servicing, having been out all day enjoying the City.Then when you get charged for facilities that you haven't had, and are ignored and blanked when you ask to discuss the charge against the level of service you have received, then you will see the true face of people who want your money only, knowing you are powerless to do anything about it.Avoid this hotel like the plague, being close to Times Square is not worth this experience.",1,Geoff S,Dec-19
407,Unbelievably great NYC hotel ,My 7 year old daughter and myself took our first trip to NYC together and stayed at Hotel Edison at the recommendation of a friend. With my first call to the hotel after booking I knew we’d made the right choice. Customer service at the hotel is the best I’ve come by in a while. Everyone there from front desk to security made sure that our visit was comfortable and enjoyable. I could tell that our room had been updated- the bathroom was beautiful. We ordered room service from one of the on-site restaurants which was delightful! We enjoyed the manager’s reception Friday night which had live music (Broadway show tunes!) free food and beverages. My daughter made friends with the man who checked us in and looked forward to seeing him (and him telling her that she was his favorite guest) everytime we walked through the lobby. She had a bear in the bed one morning and it was mistakenly taken with the laundry when the room was serviced. We let security know and they found it and returned it to her. We could see HAMILTON from the window in our room because you’re in Times Square and right by Broadway. There wasn’t any loud noise in the room though and there was blackout shades that blocked any lights. Our stay was perfection and can’t wait to go back!,5,Emily P,Jan-20
408,Worst night in so called upscale hotel,"This was one of the worst experiences in a hotel hat I have had, especially for a hotel that claims to be 3 star and upscale.   They state that ""Comfort is key"" but they need to take a look at their rooms.  The rooms desperately need to be upgraded and renovated.  The bathroom was so small you practically had to step over the toilet bowl to get into the shower.  There was a pipe cover in the bathroom that was pulling away from the wall and the bathroom door was broken.   The paint was off the floor moldings and chipping in other places and everything was dingy.  The ventilation in the room was not working properly and the room was warm and stale and stuffy all night.  When you got into the elevators all you smelled was smoke and in the hallways it was dirty and we felt like we did not want to even touch the walls.   I complained to upper management and nothing was done.  I emailed the company and the hotel and nothing was done.  Poor customer service on both parts.  It was very upsetting especially because the cost of the room was not cheap at all.  I will never stay in a Triumph Hotel again.",1,Mrs Flead,Dec-19
409,Excellence at an Affordable Price!,"Having stayed here before as I do in many of New York’s Theatre District hotels for business, I am constantly impressed with the excellence of the staff. At the reception alone there are are many caring and helpful professionals with the most impressive and beautiful being a multilingual young lady named Justina. Everyone seems to have a heart and genuinely wants their guests ‘ happiness.The Manager ‘s Reception is a complimentary( and very good) wine and hors d’oeuvres buffet with music offered by wonderful Broadway singers and piano. The superb, gracious and concerned general manager, Scott, even hosts the party. Imagine actually having the manager of such a major hotel right in the lobby to greet you! Unheard of New York.All the rooms are renovated and well maintained thanks to the responsible and friendly housekeeping staff. They will do anything they can to make sure your stay is comfortable.When I may make my own decisions on where I am staying in New York, the Edison is my personal favorite- excellence at an affordable price!!",5,Michael H,Dec-19
410,The best service hands down!,"The best service hands down! The owner Roger and the staff I’ve encountered made this a birthday trip to remember! The breakfast at Friedman’s restaurant was amazing. The most mesmerizing attractions were right outside the hotel. It was amazing thank you, Will be back soon!",5,Keith,Jan-20
411,My Return to Hotel Edison After 50 Years!,"To my absolute delight, my four night stay at Hotel Edison, after an absence of 50 years, was beyond nostalgic and far exceeded my expectations. Five decades ago my Mom used to take me for annual holiday trips to NY to visit museums, visit Radio City Music Hall, and most especially to see theater. We always stayed at Hotel Edison in the heart of Times Square. On a lark I checked to see if the hotel was still in business, and to my amazement it was. What I found was pure treasure! The ambiance, charm, and warm welcome made me feel as though I had come home. I was thrilled by the cleanliness and beauty of the lobby and easy check-in. My room was ready even before the published arrival time. There is so much to praise about Hotel Edison, including the immaculate guest room, the proximity to the TXTS booth, Friedman's Restaurant in the hotel, the safety and security, excellent price, and most especially the attentiveness and responsiveness of the staff. Silvia, the lovely woman who cleaned my room on the 20th floor, cheerfully greeted me each morning, and we'd chat for a bit. I had the pleasure of meeting the Front Office Manager, Eric Boamah and the General Manager, Scott Geres. They were wonderfully kind and accommodating. Robbi Moss, Guest Relations Ambassador, lights up the lobby with his irrepressible grin and genuine love of the hotel and appreciation for each guest. I can't wait to return...hopefully soon!",5,Michele T,Jan-20
412,New Year 2020,"We were a party of 2 couples who booked 2 rooms. Whilst we couldn’t fault the size of our room, our friends were allocated, what could only be described as a walk-in cupboard. Our room had no safe, although our friends did. Our room was clean, although somewhat dated. The customer service given to us by the staff on reception can only be described as unacceptable. They were rude, abrupt & basically, had no interest in answering any of our questions. Whilst the location of the hotel is brilliant, the complete lack of customer service skills offered to us means that we wouldn’t book this hotel again, nor would we recommend it to any of our friends",3,SHARON,Jan-20
413,Amazing!!,"My husband and I had the pleasure of visiting the Big Apple recently. We had an amazing time!!! We stayed at The Hotel Edison in Times Square, where we were treated like royalty! Our room was lovely and very well appointed. I commend and thank the entire Edison hotel staff for making our stay so comfortable. A very special shout out goes to Jaclyn, from Guest Services, who assisted us with tickets to a show, dinner reservations at the Sea Grill at Rockefeller Center, and direction on how to get from one place to another. This is an outstanding, helpful, and professional young woman, who guided us, which helped to make our visit so enjoyable. I can’t give the staff of the Hotel Edison and their Guest Relations personnel enough kiddos! You’re all AMAZING!!! THANK YOU for what is now a wonderful memory! We’ll definitely be back!!",5,barbboh,Jan-20
414,Great location for tourists,"Great location  and close to subway and some attractions, with nice and kind staff , the room was tidy but the bathroom was old and need renovation. parking is too expensive and you can only one time  check out and in during 24 hours.",4,Abi,Dec-19
415,New Years Eve 2019,"We are a family of four visiting for the NYE celebration in the Times Square. We checked in on Sunday-Dec 29, 2019. It was a long line to check in (which was expected). When we got to our room (#517), the TV was not working. We tried to call down to any line to get assistance and the phone had a “busy” tone the whole time. We had to fix the TV hookup. It was ridiculous. Then there was a toxic fume that we couldn’t pinpoint where it was coming from. I attributed to the Old dated status of the Hotel itself. By the next morning, I heard noises and banging to which I open my hotel door and saw them fixing patches on ceiling literally across from our door!! It went on from moment I open the door at 9am to 3:00pm!! Then the smell from the paint seeped in and made it caustic for us to breathe. Spoke to a Danny by security and he said to come see him. That evening I didn’t see Danny bur was told to get in line to speak to front desk. I had Juan and I address the situation with him. He did not apologize for the incident and just said “so you want another room?”. So, we were assigned another room (#321!). It didn’t have the smell to it, however, it was against the wall and all we heard was loud clanking and banging sounds all day and all night!! And to make it worse, our next door room was so noisy all night, even taking it to the hallway. I had to call security twice in 35 min. Once at 3:52am and then again at 4:20am. Steven from security supposedly took care of the issues. Room occupancy should be 4. It sounded like their was way more than 4 ppl in the room. Needless to say, definitely don’t recommend coming back here. Customer service is lacking. The hotel is outdated. They charge exorbitant fees because it’s in Times Square. And Our heater wasn’t working and I was freezing all night!! For the money we spent, I felt like I was staying at a Hostel. And we tried using the phone in the new room and it didn’t work either!! Dial 0 to get someone!",2,Linda C,Dec-19
416,Birthday trip,Firstly the customer service is wonderful! Can’t fault it it!!.HOWEVER the room..... Very dated and falling apart. I would advise to book an updated room!!!!! We were moved to another room but it was as the same. I have been to NY several times and wouldn’t stay here again.,1,Hel,Nov-19
417,Great Stay at Hotel Edison,"Hotel Edison was an excellent hotel for our needs, right in the heart of Times Square.  It could not be more convenient for walking to Broadway shows.  The hotel was clean, service was great, and the location was perfect.  We have stayed here several times before and are always quite satisfied.",5,debjen321,Dec-19
418,stay during christmas week,"We were at the Hotel Edison from 25 to 27 December. The three of us were in a double room. The room and the bathroom were perfectly fine. If you are in the immediate vicinity of Times Square, you simply have to accept that the windows cannot completely contain the street noise. So I can only warmly recommend the hotel",4,Matthias F,Dec-19
419,Perfect location close to Time Square,"This hotel is very close to time square and is ideally located to be able to walk to most main attractions. Very friendly staff in all areas of the hotel and we stayed on the 15th floor with great views across the river Hudson.Our only critisism would be that the basic Queen room that we stayed in was in need of a makeover as rather dated, however very clean though. Bed was very comfortable.If you want to be close to the central action in Manhatten then this is the ideal hotel.",4,emlagabe,Dec-19
420,Great Stay,"We stayed here recently the weekend before Christmas in a family suite.  We were there for a girl's trip with three adults and three children.  The location was perfect, and the room was perfect to accommodate our three families.  There was a king size bed in one room and two queen beds in the other room, which perfectly accommodated us.  The bathroom was also nicely updated.  The staff wasn't super friendly, but I would stay here again for the size of the room and the location.",4,Allison B,Dec-19
421,New Year Eve Celebration,Ms Justina and Mr Eric helped us enormously.  Ms Justina went super extra miles to accommodate us in signature suite to enjoy the New Year Eve with my elderly parents �� . Kudos to her !!!!! Party Favors with champagne was awesome!! Maids in our floor were also  fantastic!!! Totally an awesome experience.. Signature room was classy!!,5,VinuRaj,Dec-19
422,The staff made it for us,Although we started off with a bump in the road Danny and his team were fantastic and looked after us all so well. The Irish girlies went home happy which was down to the staff at the Edison thanks guys for everything,4,Penny Mongey,Oct-19
423,Christmas in New York,Five points for location - a few steps away from Times Square.Have previously stayed here and decided to revisit. A lot of upgrades in that time to the downstairs area but not a lot to some of the rooms.I appreciate that this was a busy time however the rooms that we were provided were older and in need of repair with work required to heating in one of the rooms.I do acknowledge that management has offered an upgrade in the future however it is unfortunately too late for this trip.Would not recommend staying in a classic room.,3,KylieM2401,Dec-19
424,Top notch service !,I was greatly impressed with the service I received on my recent stay.I had a complication with my reservation and was kindly taken care of by the front desk manager Eric. All the staff I encountered were friendly. I would stay here again.,4,DBNG,Dec-19
425,Very good,"Here now , rooms are basic nothing fancy but comfortable bed are great rooms are clean, it's very central if your looking luxury this is not for you but , its home from home with no frills, reception staff are a bit rude an some staff are not very helpful but you get by ,",3,Trip772355,Dec-19
426,Family get away,Great hotel. Has that NY style and the location is excellent. Very accommodating staff and clean rooms. A little noisy outside but your in NYC. We stayed 2 nights for a family get away. Breakfast at Freidmans next door is gluten free so not my favorite but there is a deli on 49th with great breakfast. We loved our trip,5,Shelley R,Dec-19
427,Location and Room Service,"Hotel Edison is located in the heart of Times Square, very convenient. Special mention to room service lady ""Majeda Khan"". She was very attentive to details and did a great job. We as a family enjoyed the hotel and service. We will stay here again in the future.",5,Mohsin Mirza,Dec-19
428,Only gets better over the years!,"My family and I have been visiting the Hotel Edison for what seems like decades and I can tell you, its a hidden gem right in Times Square.  Convenient to everything there is to do in the heart of the busiest city in the world.  I post this review at the risk of even more people liking the hotel and kicking me out of my favorite holiday spot so please don't tell anyone else!  And when you walk up to the revolving door at the entrance, look for Bobby the Doorman - he's been there from the start!",5,Jim S,Dec-19
429,Desperately needs updating,"This hotel has a great location just of Time Square. The rooms are apparently in the process of being updated unfortunately we didn't get one, we asked for a change of room but other rooms where no better. If going to this hotel try to book an updated room.ProblemsPaint peeling and cracking on ceiling, room probably not decorated for a few years, carpet pieced and frayed in places. Tiles on floor and walls cracked in bathroom.Rooms where cleaned daily and sheets changed staff where pleasant.On arrival we where asked to pay a deposit of $250 per room which we where not told about before hand so try to prepare before.If you can't guarantee a updated room I would look for somewhere else rooms where that bad.",2,Raymond W,Dec-19
430,Perfectly New York,"Lovely room with a terrace, providing a city view and yet completely quiet for sleeping.  The renovations provided a roomy shower, good-sized room with luxurious King bed, great coffee in the room with the bottled water provided at no additional charge.  Efficient and accommodating staff.  Bond 45 needs to offer Crown Royal, but is otherwise great.  Loved Nadine (entertainment) at The Rum House in the evening, where everyone has a great time and the workers hustle with a smile.",5,Tessa,Dec-19
431,Ready for the action!,"Just back from a pre Christmas family break to New York - our favourite time to visit,Love New York at Christmas, they sure know how to do it. Everywhere is buzzing, the decorations are fantastic as is the atmosphere. We are are a party of 6 adults, a twelve year old, 5,4 and a 20 month old, so wanted to be really central and not too posh as we just wanted to relax and enjoy. The Edison was recommended to us and fitted the bill perfectly. Being just a couple of steps down 47th street from Times Square, we could pretty much walk everywhere, Central Park, Empire State, etc. Would probably recommend the subway for down town area, Ground Zero and trips to the Statue of Liberty.The hotel is Art Deco and really nice downstairs. Two restaurants, for breakfast or dining, no proper bar that I could see, but there were lounging areas.Always busy as well priced hotel, but staff always polite and helpful, Rooms are showing their age, but are clean and well provided with TV, toiletries, plenty of towels, hair dryer, iron and ironing board and a safe.To sum up, really well positioned hotel, really well located and reasonably priced.",3,Teresa M,Dec-19
432,Perfect location,We recently stayed at Hotel Edison for a Christmas trip to NY.  It was perfect.  The rooms were very clean and spacious.  The hotel was located conveniently near the theater district as well as Times Square.  Felt like we could walk easily anywhere.  On Tuesday they had an awesome little social with a great two piece band and snacks and wine.  Very nice.  Also the restaurant attached to the hotel had a great happy hour in the evening that made the perfect meet-up spot before our night began.  Would recommend this hotel highly.,5,sorrento food tour 8 places,Dec-19
433,Excellent location,"I surprised my husband for his 40th birthday with a week to New York, staying in the Hotel Edison. Upon arrival we were given an awful room, close to the ground floor and so noisy outside; I felt like I was trying to sleep on the pavement. After informing the reception staff; they moved us immediately to the “refurbished” part of the hotel, higher up, where it was quieter. Staff were very helpful and did what they could to rectify it straight away, couldn’t fault them. The hotel location is beyond perfect. You walk out of the doors and turn right and you’re in the centre of Times Square! It couldn’t be any better. The room and bathroom were on the small side, but were very clean. The brilliant cleaners came in and out in fresh bottled water and toiletries daily. The room had a large cupboard/wardrobe which was handy not only to hang up our clothes, but store our cases in so they were out of the way. The room had a lovely big heater (and it was way below freezing outside on some days!) which meant the room was always warm when we got back from a busy day out. We didn’t use any taxis while we were there; everything was within walking distance. We went to see Dirty Dancing on Broadway which was a 10 minute walk away (if that!). Juniors restaurant is a 10 minute walk away; a must visit to try their cheesecake; best we’ve ever had! And they were super friendly in there too. The only time we got on the subway was to visit the 9/11 museum (which again, reflects the excellent location). We did all the touristy things; shopping (Macy’s, Bloomingdales, etc), Madame Tussaud’s, bus tour, broadway show, Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, Central Park, grand central station, 9/11, Rockefeller’s centre, Trump Tower, M&M and Hershey World, boat ride down the River Hudson, visited the “Golden Bull”, Madison Square Gardens, Hooters (my idea, not the husbands; brilliant food and service!)...you name it; we did it! And everything, other than 9/11, was within walking distance from the hotel! I can’t stress the brilliant location enough! You have to show your key card to the security card, day or night, before being allowed to go into the lifts to the rooms. I thought this was an excellent reassuring security measure! Just make sure you remember to take it if you’re popping out for a cigarette or to the shop to get some pop!The third night we were there, they held their weekly wine, nibbles and music evening, for free. Was a lovely atmosphere with very talented performers. Was a lovely start before our evening out together. There is an Irish bar a few doors down from the hotel, on the same side of the street. A lovely night out, live music, excellent atmosphere and the drinks were reasonably priced (something rare in a city!) If you keep walking down, At the bottom of the road there is a lovely sandwich cafe on the corner (they do taweaway too) which make the nicest sandwiches and pizza ever!Upon arrival, the doorman helped us with our bags into the hotel and upon leaving, he waved down a taxi for us, made sure we paid the correct price (we were massively ripped off on our way to the hotel by a taxi) before we got in and loaded all our bags into the boot for us. Was very friendly and helpful. Reading the negative reviews on here surprised me. When you go to somewhere like New York, you want somewhere clean,Warm and comfortable to sleep, friendly and excellent location to see the city and the sites. It’s not a beach break, so it’s not as though you spend very much time in the hotel. This hotel had all of that. We loved it and would stay there again.",5,Heather D,Feb-19
434,Noisy Hotel,"The Hotel Edison is definitely in a great location, very close to the Broadway shows we were seeing.  It was quite chaotic in the lobby at check-in but they did have some sofas and chairs while you waited.  However I have to say that the restroom located in that area needs some sort of better venting system.  The foul odor really wafted into the lobby area.  Our room was fine but there was another door very close catty-corner.  The doors are VERY heavy and noisy.  Almost everyone lets them slam, especially the cleaning staff.  It happened so much one morning with that corner room that I opened my door and found that it was the housekeeper going in and out, not very considerate of the other guests.  I asked her to please hold the door and she said she would.  We had breakfast vouchers.  It helped with expenses but it is a very limited menu.  We didn't eat any other meals at the hotel.There are a lot of hotels in the area and I think we will try another one on our next stay.",3,Theresa L,Nov-19
435,Reception Staff,"I do not wish to comment on the hotel itself but I do want to take the time to appreciate the receptionist Jusina who helped me with checking out on Christmas Day 2019. I cannot thank you enough for your kindness and understanding Jusina. You went above and beyond to help me after I began to despair that a holiday full of mishaps was going from bad to worse. You were very kind to me and helped make me smile when I thought I might just burst into tears, thankyou. I very much hope that Hotel Edison appreciate you and your commitment to customer service, there was no one better in the whole time I stayed there.",5,Shal M,Dec-19
436,It was like trading in a Rolls Royce for an old beat up station wagon!!!,"The hotel Edison was built in 1931 and it’s been riding on that reputation for far too long. I Reserved a terrace room from 12/23-1/3/2020. when we checked in they told me the terrace room I reserved in aug/sept was only available until 12/29 then I would have to move to a different room. I had 2 choices for rooms and both rooms were totally unacceptable!! The terrace room wasn’t perfect, but it was soo close. we didn’t have a view of the New Years ball falling but the view was still pretty good, no tall buildings against us and it had an open view and feeling around us. The room we were moved to was half the size of the terrace room, the entrance hall was so narrow the bell hop couldn’t bring the luggage in w/o hitting the walls. the bathroom was truly a joke it was a cracker box compared to the terrace bathroom. all the painted surfaces had so many nicks and scrapes it was hard to tell the true color. the door knobs and the paint were sticky and looked as though the were never polished. Even the bedding was substandard we didn’t even have a comforter. our view was a 360• from the terrace room, we looked at another big ugly hotel directly across from us, it was so maddening! Then we saw that along with the big ugly building we were at the front of the hotel with all the hustle and bustle and traffic u find on every street in New York City, trying to sleep was a true joy. Our first half hour in that room we heard 2 emergency vehicles go down the street.  It was like trading in a Rolls Royce for an old beat up station wagon!!!",1,Janet S,Dec-19
437,Great location but terrible communication,"First of all, I'll touch on the positives. Check in was quick and easy. Hotel is in a great location, literally a few yards off times square. The cleaners were brilliant, kept us well stocked with toiletries, water and clean towels.Now for the negatives, the rooms appear very dated with very little natural light. Upon check in they charged my card with a holding fee, this fee was not held they took the $100 straight out of my account. Upon check in I also advised the concierge that wee for 1 night and continued to try following nights until I put a freeze on my card. On check out, I paid the full room tax  balance for the stay in cash, I informed the concierge that money had already been taken and he reassured me that any money that had been charged to my card prior to this would be refunded. Well I am now 14 days since check out and zero money refunded and zero response to my emails leaving me $133 short over the festive period.As of this moment I am still waiting for this money to be refunded onto my card.",2,Laura S,Dec-19
438,Christmas in NYC,"Myself and my daughter stayed at the Edison for 5 nights over christmas including Christmas Day. we had an amazing stay from check in with Sam who was extremely helpful to checkout which was simple and straightforward, we were pleasantly surprised by the room after reading some hit and miss reviews on trip advisor. I had stayed here some years previously and had a beautiful clean room on that occasion too. We had beautiful views of Times Square and Broadway from our beautiful room which was kept spotlessly clean by the lovely Rose. All staff we encountered were courteous and helpful and security seemed extremely diligent and easy to deal with. we will definitely return again. Thanks again.",5,lyndsey,Dec-19
439,Close to Times Square,"Our room was a signature (upgraded) room, smaller than expected, but still functional.  Bathroom has recently been remodeled with upgraded fixtures.  Queen bed was comfortable, flat screen tv in room.  Quick elevators (we were on the 20th floor).Front desk staff are courteous and friendly. Security is good with someone checking for room key cards before entering the elevator area to access rooms.  The only thing i disliked was the ""resort fee"" being charged per night (be prepared for a $25.00 per night charge)  I thought the room charge and taxes were a little excessive for the size of the room, but if you want quick and easy access to Times Square, you will like this place.",4,Jerry K,Dec-19
440,"Great location awful hotel,do not go.","A family of four from the UK, we took our daughters to Newyork for their 18th and 21st birthday presentWe where so excited to spend 6 days in this amazing city. Then spoilt by this Rotton old hotel.the rooms are old, smelly and dirty. Mold in the bathrooms and an air conditioning unit that has seen better days I complained at 6 50 the first morning we had no sleep, every hour the air machine would kick in it sounded like someone was banging on the unit with a hammer. A massive gap in the window and no hot water. The lighting in all rooms was dismal as no natural light as all windows face a wall I complained and I was treated so badly by Carlos, he moved us with reluctance the room that was given was worse than the original room.They offered a signature room but had to pay double we declined I decided to speak to the manager who agreed, to move us but two days later. We lived out of the suitcases for an entire 6 days. Moved again to a signature room bigger and better but no natural light. The rooms had the blinds drawn and you couldn't open them So many people where complaining about rooms. FREIDMANS BAR,stay away if Adam is begind the bar so very rude and overcharged. Complained to his boss, shrugged his shoulders.We where bitten by bedbug you could see the blood where they had bitten on the sheets. Bell boys and cleaners are great so If you decide to stay at this horrible place then make sure you look after them.Great location but horrible hotel,0wners you need to sort it out and change the photos, they are not representative of your ESTABLISHMENT.",1,Jo Deen,Dec-19
441,Holidays in Time Square,"My family has been staying at the Edison since the 60’s. We love it! Even though my kids live in Brooklyn it was fun to spend the 24th in Manhattan. It’s close to transit, Broadway and shopping. The murals in the lobby really capture New York.",4,Shawn R,Dec-19
442,"Excellent location, comfortable rooms and friendly staff","Stayed here with my best friend in December 2019 whilst we were on a joint 30th birthday celebration trip. When checking in we were welcomed by Brian on the reception desk who was lovely! He made us feel very welcome and explained everything in clear detail and answered any questions we had. He explained that we had been upgraded and given a late check out until 14.00 as a gesture from the hotel, which was a lively gesture. When we entered our room we were surprised at the small size and old fashioned decor, we asked ourselves what the original room was like if this was an upgrade?! Anyway the room was comfortable and had everything threat we needed so we unpacked and settled in. Room was cleaned and made up daily with towels, toiletries, water bottles and coffee replaced daily. One evening we asked at reception for extra water and this was delivered to our room within 10 minutes which we thought was very fast given that it was late at night and we expected staff to be fewer.  My only niggle was that there was only 1 bathrobe provided despite there being 2 of us in the room - this could have been resolved if I had have informed reception but as it was not a big issue I did not mention it to them. However I have every faith that a second robe would have been sent to the room immediately if I had have asked for it. Overall, every staff member that we encountered was very friendly and welcoming, especially reception and the security at the elevator/lift doors.  Location is fantastic, 30 seconds from Times Square and close to many popular sights, subway stations and transport links. I would definitely recommend and would stay here again.",5,Gemma,Dec-19
443,First Visit to NY,"Finally after years of waiting, we got to NY, the city that never sleeps!!Arrival and check-in at the Edison was quick and easy. On arriving into our room we quickly decided that the room was well below the standard we were hoping for. We turned around and went straight back to reception. We pointed out that the bath surround was mouldy, the room was a shoe box and there where no drinks facility. We were told that there was no other rooms available unless we paid extra for an upgrade. $160 dollars later we had a bigger room, clean and a coffee machine. Sadly there was no fridge for cold drinks or milk.Hotel staff seems pleasant enough, and the building itself inside is beautiful, Art Deco. The Rum bar on the premises is small and often very full, live music and great cocktails. Be warned the drinks are pricey and you are expected to tip on top of that. We are in the restaurant once for breakfast, this was very good. Service was excellent and the food was plentiful. The Edison is a three star hotel and our room showed that, even with the paid upgrade. Next time, we will pay extra for a more plush hotel and not one just off Times Square. I’d look for one in Brooklyn and travel into Manhattan on the subway or I’d walk. I loved NY, I will most certainly go again",3,mick D,Oct-19
444,Classic New York Holiday Experience!,New York + The Holidays + The Edison Hotel = the perfect traditional vacation. The staff makes all the difference with their kindness and professionalism. The location is ideal for easy access to the theatre and an amazing array of restaurants as well as many of the museums.,5,Janice K,Dec-19
445,Best hotel in Manhattan,"This was our second visit to the Edison & again it didnt let us down. We were in a Signature 2 Queen bed room & it was amazing. Spotless & cleaned every day. The staff were so friendly as always, and extremely helpful. Marcus in reception was so helpful & really went out of his way for us. We had breakfast in the restaurant & Julia waited on us, she was so friendly & made it a very pleasant experience. We only came home on 19 Dec & on Christmas night we booked again for next year! The location is fab, 30 second walk from Times Square & so central to everything - Broadway theatres, Central Park, 5th Ave, Macys, Bloomingdales etc & very close to the Port Authority where we got our bus to Jersey Gardens. We really cant wait to go back again next year to our favourite hotel, see you all soon �",5,kathyemcg,Dec-19
446,Perfectly arranged hotel accommodations turned into nightmare,"We planned a special birthday getaway to New York City and booked the Edison Hotel, which we have used consistently for at least 15 years, from October 15 to 20, 2019 . We booked online and selected a signature room with a terrace as shown in the online photo description. This terrace showed a table and chairs with ample room to have a meal outside and enjoy  the view. I hoped to enjoy a cigar on the balcony on my birthday.When we arrived at the hotel, we were told that such a room was not available till the next night. We were extremely upset. After planning and arranging a wonderful trip, we now faced unpacking, packing and resettling again. In compensation we were given breakfast vouchers for the duration of our stay. The next day we were given another room but there was no terrace. They offered us slight reduction on our room rate and another change of room for the next day.Now on the third day of our five day stay, we were given yet another room. This room did have a strip of balcony, but we could not even put a chair outside to sit on, there was no room. Management made it very difficult to exit to the balcony. It required a special key which we needed to arrange for well in advance. This latest room was so tiny, there were no dressers or shelves at all. We lived out of our suitcase. The bed took up all the room space. Upon our return home, we received a questionnaire for commenting on our stay. After completing this questionnaire, honestly expressing our dissatisfaction, we received an e-mail from the General Manager, Scott Geres, offering apologies and a complimentary upgrade to a newly renovated signature suite, for our next visit. We will write an updated review, after taking this opportunity in 2020.",3,2015SI,Oct-19
447,A confortable stay in the heart of the Big Apple,We stay in Edison Hotel just before Christmas and we enjoyed the strategic position very close to the best places to see in that magical period. The very good confort of the room allowed us to recovery during the night.,5,Andrea B,Dec-19
448,Nice stay,"Dated hotel with only some of the rooms modernised with ours being one that hadn’t. This said, the bed was comfy and clean and the shower was perfect. We did find hairs in the bath on arrival but it was clean straight away. Overall, great hotel if you only use it as base. Starbucks across the road with everything a stones throw away.",4,8damo,Dec-19
449,Good Location But Poor Hotel,"On arrival the check in was pretty quick considering there was a lot of people checking in and out. On arrival to our rooms on the sixth floor (632,634,638) thought yes this is nice, then when we opened the door to our room or should i say closet the room was so small the so called bathroom well the toilet blocked your access to the bath and the sink was right by the door so if your were using the sink nobody else could use the bathroomThen we found the wallpaper was hanging off and plaster was also falling off Went to check on my friends rooms and one of them said he wasn't happy as his bath had been painted and the paint was coming away and they also had wallpaper hanging off. The other couples room was better and bigger so they stayed with that roomOff me and my mate went off to complain, the manager wasn't to happy about the complaint, when i said the rooms looked nothing like the on line photo's he said that's expedia for you but i hadn't booked with expedia i had booked through last minute .com he just looked at us and put his head downHe did move us to two bigger rooms on the 12th floor (1222, 1224) which we accepted as the hotel was full. But these rooms also had failings like you could hear the main air con units for the building all day and night also there was loud music coming from either another building or another part of the hotel it went on till around 1 am Sat,Sun,Mon Thur.We couldn't move again as the hotel was full with it being so close to christmas We never ate or drank in the hotel as it was a bit expensive, we found a restaurant for breakfast called the Galaxy on ninth avenue two blocks down from the hotel and it was very reasonable Sorry to say if i return to New York would find a different hotel to stay in, The Edison's location is good for time square and central to most other attractions, Don't be fooled by the pictures you see on the web sites there not accurate our original rooms' were meant to be accessible Queen rooms. Will say the staff were good the rooms were cleaned everyday and clean towels and linen were changed regularly other than that we didn't really have anything to do with the hotelOur stay was for 7 nights with friends to celebrate a 50th birthday.New York is an amazing place",3,auzl14,Dec-19
450,Fab hotel in a great location,"We stayed at the Edison for 4 nights in mid December.  I contacted the hotel prior to travelling and they gave us a refurbished room.   We were on the 17th floor, the room was new, clean and had everything we needed - there was a proper hairdryer which is a big thumbs up from me! The room had bottles of water each day, coffee machine and a selection of toiletries which were replenished daily. The bed was so comfy and pillows amazing! Definitely what you needed after long days sightseeing. There was music on in the ball room on the Friday and Saturday night which was incredibly loud but it did finish at midnight on the dot so it was not an issue. I had read reviews before we travelled about hearing the noise of traffic and people but we were on the 17th floor so could not hear people however there was some traffic noise but I loved that - that is NYC!  If you don't want to hear the hustle and bustle then don't stay in a central hotel! Hotel was a great location to get anywhere.  Bags could be left on the day of departure for $1 a bag.  We would definitely stay here again. The only thing that did disappoint me was that I taped dollars to large bars of Cadbury chocolate for housekeeping each day and one day they untapped the $, took them and left the chocolate which I felt was a bit ungrateful when I was just giving them some chocolate as well, because it was Christmas!  Top hotel, top stay - thank you!",5,TheBearsWife,Dec-19
451,Christmas break for our 30th Wedding Anniversary,"We stayed in a queen room on the 19th floor. Small but clean and comfy, we slept well, but only one bath robe for 2 guests? there are coffee making facilities in the room. The Edison is very close to Times Square and centrally located for most tourist must do’s. Staff were pleasant and helpful. We had breakfast vouchers for the restaurant Friedman’s, which provided us with a limited selection of breakfast fare, which got busy over the weekend so I would suggest you go earlier rather than later. The lobby is always busy. Overall we had a great time and the Edison was a great base to explore from. Would recommend.",3,nataliesmith3112,Dec-19
452,Great Hotel,"Stayed for 5 nights in a trip to New York for Christmas, Nice room, a bit small but well appointed The Hotel is right in the heart  near Time Square and Broadway very clean, the staff were very pleasant, the food in the restaurant was good too.",5,Mario P,Dec-19
453,Would stay again but...,"I enjoyed my stay here, the staff were pleasant and it served as a good base during our break.However, our room looked nothing like the ones advertised. I was aware that some of the rooms had been renovated, ours was obviously one one of the rooms that hadnt. Very tired looking, wallpaper looked like it was ready to fall off and the bathroom needed updating badly.The room was clean, bed comfy and to be honest that's all we wanted so we didnt ask for a different room.Personally I would stay here again but if you want a modern and fancy room then I would choose a different hotel.",4,icklesal,Dec-19
454,Great Spot for a NYC visit,Stayed for 5 nights in a trip to the Big AppleNice room if a bit small but well appointedThe Hotel is right in the heart of things and all of the City’s attractions are close by or just a short subway ride awayThe staff were all helpful with directions etcThe separate bar The Rum House was a great place for a night capThis Hotel was perfect for our stay and is highly recommended,5,Alasdair0169,Dec-19
455,Our concierge was wonderful.,"Our room was really perfect. Very clean, loved having bottled water. I am up in age and need to stay hydrated.  So close to broadway, within easy walking distance. The edison made our stay in New York very relaxing.",5,Global63282,Dec-19
456,Great Location,"Great Location , just off Times Square and Broadway , easy walk to lots of attractions and close to subway stations too. The hotel felt very nostalgic Very efficient check in and check out process My room for perfect for me , I slept really well , comfortable bed and very quiet The ""Edison Hour"" was a nice touch",5,Emma J,Dec-19
457,Moved rooms twice,"This is the second time I’ve stayed at the Edison. The first time was great. Location is spot on, you are literally on Times Square. When we checked in we had to pay a City Tax of $120, which we were not aware of. We were given a family room (there was 3 adults) on the 14th floor. When we opened the door the smell of damp hit you, the room was very tired and old fashioned. The radiator was hanging off the wall, the blind was broke, skirting board was missing and the bath was full of rust. We complained and was told that we’d booked a budget room, which we didn’t, they moved us to a family room on the 6th floor. This was marginally better, although the damp smell was stronger and we didn’t feel comfortable walking around with bare feet we stayed for one night. The following morning, I complained again to reception, the room was not up to scratch. I explained that I had recommended this hotel and I was embarrassed. After a conversation with the Manager, Stephen, he moved us to a Signature family room on 18th floor. That room was amazing. When we booked, we did not pay budget, so how they can pass the first two rooms off as budget is beyond me. They were both disgusting, I didn’t know hotel rooms like that existed and I have stayed in plenty of budget hotels. The price you pay for the rooms at Edison should mean that they all look like Signature rooms. I have still given this hotel a 4 because the staff are amazing, the location is amazing and our final room was amazing. Just check what you are getting when you book",4,thechiefscouse,Nov-19
458,Perfect hotel with a great location,"I have nothing but good things to say about our stay at the Edison. The location is perfect. Our room was spotless and updated and ready when we arrived. The housekeeping staff was friendly and prompt with extra towels, a toothbrush and other items we needed. The front desk folks were helpful and worked hard to make sure everything was perfect. What a great location, too. We were right in the theater district and a short walk from everything we needed. I’d definitely stay here again.",5,Susan H,Dec-19
459,Perfect Location,"We stayed for 4 nights in November. The hotel was beautiful and so perfectly located for exploring the big apple. Our room was very comfortable, small but we weren't expecting much space in New York! The hotel looks like it has been recently refurbished. There was toiletries and bottled water available, refreshed every day. Housekeeping was exceptional, the room was spotless. Downstairs there is a bar and restaurant. There was a live jazz bank on, each night we were there in the bar area. The staff, every single person we encountered were so vert friendly, helpful and courteous. There is a tourist information desk in the lobby where you can book all of your tickets for everything and they were super helpful with any queries that  we had. It felt like home away from home and we cannot wait to return again.",5,Athlone Whiskey Tours,Nov-19
460,Great Location ,"Hotel Edison is in the middle of Times Square which is a great location for walkers. It is close to the stop for the Hop on/Hop off tour bus and within walking distance of so many Broadway shows. You literally could stay here and never have to Uber if you were just going to shows. We walked an average of over 4 miles a day and did call Ubers/Lyfts to go to other areas of the city. The room may be smaller than most, but since we would leave in the morning and not return until the afternoon, this wasn’t a huge problem for us. Bathroom also may be more cramped and there is only a shower but again, not an issue for our group! The shower was remodeled and huge!! There was no refrigerator which I wish we had but again with the size of the room this may caused it to be mire cramped. They did provide waters and other snacks which was from the daily charge which was good so we could take them with us each day. Plugs....this was the first thing my daughter noticed!! There was more than enough plug ins for everyone to plug in their electronic devices! No fighting over whose turn to plug in their device. Everyone had a plug in on their side of the bed which was very nice. The only negative... I don’t know if it was Housekeeping or who but there seemed to a lot of loud noise in the morning and at night. Slamming doors, etc. You do feel safe because you have to show your room key in order to access the elevators in order to go upstairs to the rooms. Very good idea!! Strictly enforced!! Check out was very easy. All in all a very pleasant experience and will stay there again!",4,Melanie E,Dec-19
461,Pretty good,"The room was way above my expectations after reading the other reviews. housekeeping was better than average. The staff was very friendly. forget going to The hotel bar the Rum house... it’s always packed but you might get lucky. only ate at the hotel restaurant once, it was average food but good. If you’re a light sleeper, your in a 24/7 noisy city, bring plugs. location is great for hitting all the nyc tourist stuff.",5,WorkieWork,Dec-19
462,Great Follow Up Service,"Just wanted to share a quick story about the great follow up service that we received from Roisere at the Hotel Edison in New York City.  I had inadvertently left behind a credit card in the safety deposit box.  Roisere called me a few days later to let me know the card had been found and offered to send the card to me by post.  We enjoyed the visit, and the follow up attention even more.  Thanks again.",4,Rick S,Oct-19
463,Hotel Edison,"I was very impressed by this hotel.  The room was a lot bigger than I expected for New York.  It was very clean, the staff was nice.  Felt safe they checked for room key each time you came in..  I would definitely stay there again.  It’s very close to everything and very very close to Times Square.",5,Joan,Dec-19
464,Very disappointed,"The room was shabby and run down the bathroom was disgusting, the bath had obviously been painted and paint was flaking off. The room did not look like the photos. I expected a “nice” room for $400 per night.",1,Amelia Uk,Dec-19
465,Honest Review,"After a long flight from the UK, we arrived at the hotel at around 10pm, we were waiting around 10 minutes until it was our turn to check in. Once checked in, we went to the 6th floor where our room was situated. Once we got out of the lift, a REALLY strong musty smell hit us, which wasn't pleasant at all. We got into our room and the rooms were NOTHING like they are shown on the website, almost like it was false advertising!!!! It was so dated, almost like a room from the 70's! Wallpaper was falling off, the door was falling apart and even had a big hole in it, it was unacceptable. So i went straight down to reception and asked for a NEW room, they said we would have to wait until 3pm the day later to check into a new room, which we did, on the 10th floor. The room was still dated and again, NOTHING like those photos on the website, but it was much better than what we had so we put up with it. The hotel held our bags for us while we waited to check back in, but at a price, $1 per bag.The website offers complimentary Wi-Fi but then adds this into the facility fee, which makes no sense, so we had to pay an additional $174 on check out, as if they aren't making enough money!Staff were friendly enough apart from a bell boy on our last day, who was VERY rude towards me in front of others, which was quite embarrassing for me. We slept well and the noise of times square didn't keep us awake, which is a plus! We ordered room service 1 night after a long day of walking around NYC, we ordered a sandwich each and a can of coke, this came to $60 once they added on the tax, DELIVERY FEE (It's downstairs!!!!) & gratuity fee, it was possibly the smallest sandwich i've ever had, and they can charge these prices, wow.Location was excellent, couldn't fault that. A lot of work to be done on this hotel if we were to come back, i'd advise booking elsewhere.",2,Sam19x,Dec-19
466,Disgusting!!,"We arrived after a long day and all excited. Checked in with no problem and went to our room. On entering the room it smelt weird, there were holes in the doors, some of the skirting boards were missing and mouldy in the gaps and the bath looked like it had been there since the hotel was built. I didn't want to stand in it to shower. I immediately went to reception where they gave us another room which was better. Would never go back.",2,Margaret P,Dec-19
467,"Disgusting rooms, rude staff - try book somewhere else",We stayed here for 5 nights when we checked in we had to pay 250 dollars per room 143 for fees 100 security deposit no mention of this when booking!! Manager that dealt with us was rude and would not listen. The rooms where disgusting (attached some photos). Wallpaper peeling off and black. Heating was so loud through the night sounded like a jet taking off in the room. Anytime we spoke to staff they where rude and didnt seem interested in helping. my brother was ill during the trip and asked to move rooms due to noise he was told point blank no. The outside and downstairs of the hotel is nice but don't let that mislead you it's totally different in the rooms upstairs we spoke to a few guest when there and they all said the same -rude staff and rooms are disgusting! Only thing this hotel has going for it is location but am sure there are cleaner hotels round about with nicer staff!also charge a dollar to keep bags for you disgrace considering you have paid to stay there plus 143 per room in fees before even getting your room key!! DO NOT STAY HERE,1,Drose,Dec-19
468,You only want in room to sleep or shower,Room was very shabby.  Looked like trim work had 50 coats of paint;  carpet looked fairly new but threads were pulling loose at shoe mold; bath was very small and almost no place to sit toiletries.  We had a leak in ceiling that dripped down on commode when neighbor upstairs used either the toilet or shower (we hoped it was shower).  We reported leak twice and they were going to get maintenance to check it out; never saw anybody. The charge extra $25 per night in part for good WIFI; we only got 1 of 4 devices to connect;  our devices did not like that network was unsecured.,2,Tom A,Dec-19
469,Big birthday celebration with friends ,"Stayed at this hotel for 5 days in December for a birthday treat. Staff at reception on arrival was very pleasant and a quick check in.  All the staff were very friendly and professional. Always wanted to be in New York in the holiday season so pretty.  The hotel was in excellent location right near times square, such a busy vibrant place.  We enjoyed our stay there very much  . Very comfy beds, rooms were  adequate suited our needs.  Would recommend to my friends to come hopefully again and day.  The rum house attached to the hotel we frequented about during our stay",5,Linda d,Dec-19
470,New Years Disaster,"Cancel whatever reservations you have here! Our credit card got hit with multiple fraudulent charges immediately. Price gauging, very unprofessional, and everyone speaks broken English.... extremely hard to understand. VERY SHADY! Don’t do it. Read the other reviews��������",1,Escape760912,Dec-19
471,Average Hotel,"Stayed here with my boyfriend for 5 nights in December and the location of this hotel is great! Only a short walk away from Times Square. However this hotel needs some serious improvement.  Upon arrival the que to check in took forever and all seemed very unorganised. We were given a room on the 6th floor, which in my opinion shouldn't be booked out to guests without having a refurb first. The room was dark and tired with the carpet all coming up. The bathroom wasn't much better with mould all around the bath. We went down to reception to swap rooms which the lady was more than happy to do. The room we was given on the 4th floor was a lot nicer and bigger, but lacking space to put your clothes and only one bedside table. For the price you pay per night for this hotel I would expect better quality rooms for that.I wouldn't recommend this hotel to friends and family due to the fact they could be given a room like our first one was.",3,Danielle D,Dec-19
472,Disappointed,"After waiting in line for almost an hour to check in, we found our rooms worn and tired looking, although it was relatively clean, and the beds were comfortable.  There Is a club or something next to the hotel that had an obnoxiously loud thumping bass and DJ until midnight on a Wednesday night. It met our needs in terms of location but we will not stay there again.",2,Holiday Traveler,Dec-19
473,Disappointed stay,"They say if you don’t have anything to say don’t say anything, but this hotel needs to evaluate the conditions of its rooms especially if they charge $600/night with parking. The Lobby is plain and simple the security guard checks your room card for authorization to gain access to elevator and rooms. Location is good if you want to be close to Time square. At night drug dealers were around entrance of hotel trying sell weed and drugs. The room has wall paper falling off the wall and the exterior sign is loosing numbers and flapping against the building making sleeping without noise a challenge I am sorry this hotel would not be my recommendation",2,Bettina S,Dec-19
474,Great Customer Services,"Stayed with the family for 5 nights.  The hotel is in a great location for literally every where you may need to get to, which is a big plus.Architecturally and historically the hotel is super interesting a retains many original features - and has appeared in many films - I won't spoil this for you - find out while you are there.The hotel is supported by 2 great restaurants and an amazing Rum House which plays Jazz nearly every night - all 3 are well worth a visit.Rooms clean, cosy and sufficiently sized for your stay - I mean you are in NY so you are not planning to stay in the room anyway.The most impressive thing for us was without a doubt the Customer Service - these guys go out of their way to ensure your stay is perfect.  From the Doorman to the Bell Boys to the Receptionists, their one goal is to ensure Guests are happy - and they certainly delivered where we were concerned.Big shout outs among others go to Jamie - Concierge - very attentive, Alana - Security Desk - thank you for enquiring about my wife who alas got the Flu, Christina - Receptionist - for booking our evening out at the Carnegie Club, Travis - FOH Cleaner - so friendly and always smiling and Reinalid our housekeeper.The Management at the Hotel are so visible all of the time - every morning I saw the GM, Scott, mingling with the guests, enquiring about their welfare.  Along with Scott were also his Senior Management Team, Daniel, Head of Security, Marjorie, Head of HR, Eric & Sarah, FOH - I am sure I have missed some, but you will get the idea.  They are very approachable and will answer any query you have, and go over and above to assist you.I work in a Senior Position within the Customer Services Industry so my expectations whilst realistic, need to be met.In short - well done to Hotel Edison, Scott, his Senior Management Team and all of those that keep the cogs turning.We would revisit and would recommend.",5,NJSK20,Dec-19
475,Christmas visit. ,Great hotel in great location. 2nd time staying here and if you want close to time Square it's a must. There is a night club beside it and plays loud music until late but that didn't bother us. Everyone treated us professionally and courteously apart from one person. Francis the security guard is without doubt the rudest person I met while in New York. I asked him a simple question about where I pick up my stored bags and he snapped at Mr saying I'm security and then I said ok but where do I go to get my bags and he said ask someone else. Another lady then approached him and asked where the toilets where and he pointed at the desk and said ask over there I'm security. A simple over there miss on the right would have been polite but not him. For someone representing Hotel Edison he's very rude and unprofessional. Apart from that I've no faults with the hotel at all. Would still recommend.,4,millarballs,Dec-19
476,50th Birthday,"Brilliant hotel, ideally situated for access to the whole of New York.We had a 5 night stay with no reason whatsoever to complainRooms cleaned daily, did not eat at the hotel but they do let you bring your own food in.A good base for exploring New York",5,Nigelwestwood,Dec-19
477,We wouldn't stay anywhere else!!,"It was our 5th stay at the Edison and this time there were a group of 6, myself a friend, my 2 daughters with their 2 friends. So a mixed age range (25- 54), but we all thought the Edison is the place to stay!Centrally located the Edison is just the perfect hotel. We all stayed in Signature Rooms on the 19th floor. The rooms were of a large size to accommodate 2 king beds in each, sofa, desk, chair the usual you would expect.  Beautiful marble bathrooms with huge showers and loads of hot water. We experienced excellent housekeeping, hospitality, and all the staff were very friendly. The wifi was free and to a very good standard, never dropping out, which is a must to everyone these days!A very special shout out to Rommel who looked after us before and during our stay. Absolutely impecable really can't thank him enough. The Edison really do look after all guests just let them know if you are a returning guests they love to see you again!So until next time Rommel......... we all thank you from the bottom of our hearts, Marie & crew!",5,Stephsmum,Dec-19
478,Anniversary,EXTREMELY disappointed!!!!! Room was terribly outdated. Only one side table for king size bed. Bathroom was tiny and we were in a Jr. suite. Huge gash on bathroom door. Top of dresser was damaged. Coffeemaker didn’t work. Lamp on dresser had short in the cord.,2,GApeach,Dec-19
479,Great Place to Stay,"We stayed at the Hotel Edison for 4 nights and were very impressed with the hotel. The room wasn't quite as advertised and needs updating however, it was clean and the bed was very comfortable. All the staff were very helpful and there was a lot of choice if you chose to have breakfast in their diner. Right on Times Square with easy access to subway stations to all major attractions. Would gladly recommend to friends and family.",4,Mark N,Dec-19
480,Great location,"Great location. On the corner of times square and so many theatres surrounding to catch a Broadway show. Close to Central park,Rockefeller,shopping,Empire state. Rooms a bit dated but was ok for what we needed.",4,Simon Hannaford,Dec-19
481,4 day break,"The Hotel Edison couldn’t be faulted for location right on the corner of Times Square and restaurant Feldmans next door excellent staff and food, but don’t get a room below floor 12 as very dated with paint coming off ceilings, holes in walls where fixtures had been removed and not filled in, also bath tub  enamel peeling off and  no hot water for shower although worked for bath and no kettle in room as standard.  If can over look the basic feel and only using as a place to change and sleep is ok but expected more for price.",3,Richard P,Dec-19
482,Best Hotel in NY,"I can’t change this hotel for my stays in NY. The staff is very kind and available especially Juan the consierge, i can ask him everything. He is very special. Also Janaira is very helpfull and kind with all the guests. A special thanks to this guys Who make my holidays even more beautifull. In the end Marco, a lovely doorman. i love to stay here. Best Position In the City. I hope to will come back early. (And James, David....all the Staff...�) Thank you for your Work ��",5,JeMoscow,Dec-19
483,Such a WONDERFUL Hotel...steps from time square,We had a girls trip to NYC and I was in charge of booking the hotel for us all. This is my fourth time staying at Hotel Edison. Everyone in my party LOVED the hotel!! Great location! GREAT staff!! We will definitely be back!!,5,Sandi J,Dec-19
484,December Christmas & Holiday Light Trip,"Once again the stay at the Hotel Edison didn't disappoint.  Great service, great location, and great people!  I call the hotel my home when in NY.  The location is in the heart of everything including the subway!  The service is excellent & friendly!  Security is outstanding.  The entire operation is professional, first-class!",5,FarAway41369,Dec-19
485,Tired bedrooms,"The lobby of the hotel and floors 13 upwards have been refurbished....but rooms on floor 12 haven't. Whilst the room was clean it was very tired - bathroom needs replacing. Duck tape running down the bathroom walls to cover where wiring once was for the hairdryer. Plenty of wall sockets though, reasonable selection of US TV channels but no international channels. Glazing was very poor with street noise and drafts coming through. Very noisy location right on Times Square, impossibly loud music until will after 11pm, thankfully it poured down two nights so the music was cancelled. Very good location though. Didn't try the food or bar as so many alteratives within a few blocks.",3,Traveller_from_England,Dec-19
486,Tired room needs updating and re decoration,Disappointed to learn that below floor 13 the rooms are in need of urgent updating. We were on floor 12 & it was pretty grim - far below what we'd expected. Also the noise at night from Times Square was so loud I felt as though I was at a concert - windows need to be triple glazed,3,Mrs Young,Dec-19
487,Christmas Wonderland,Best way to start off the spirit and enjoyment of the holidays.   Broadway Shows within walking distance.   Central Park and Time Square only steps away.  Hotel offers restaurants and bars within so you don’t have to venture out if exhausted from a full day of sightseeing.,5,Tour229250,Dec-19
488,Wife’s 40th Birthday,Hotel is prime location 20 second walk from Time square. clean and tidy hotel in the heart of NYC just perfect. Plenty of restaurants and bars and a easy walk to the main spots for sightseeing. Subway close it’s perfect.,4,Gal-the-gooner,Dec-19
489,Unbelievable!,"Avoid this place at all costs. First impression is good. Reception (Lobby) is very nice, the lifts are nice and the hallways look decent but behind the door of the rooms the whole experience changes completely. The windows don't close! You WILL hear everything all night long. You can't help the noise of the city, that's part of the appeal of going to NYC but the humming of all the extraction fans from other buildings. We stayed in our first room for one night before asking to change as it was so loud. Unfortunately I didn't get any pictures of that room but it was a state. There was a continuous tapping coming from the wall in this room. We couldn't put the heating on overnight as the radiators are not radiators, they are blowers of some kind and loud. That woke us the first night when the thermostat clicked in so we didn't use it again. We stayed the first week of December and the windows don't close so we woke each day to a cold room. That was Room 1122.We were moved to room on floor 14 but can;t remember the number. We took a look at the room and left straight away for another room as this was in a worse state of disrepair and the windows didn't close again. Finally we moved to 1209 and we gave up. At this point we realised the hotel just didn't have the better rooms we thought we were getting when we booked it being a 4 star hotel. We paid £1400 plus $114 in taxes on check out. We tried to connect to WiFi but you have to pay for it, it is NOT free as advertised. You join the network and it asks you to make a selection and guess what, the only option is a paid for one! I wasn't going to give this place a penny more than I had to so paid roaming charges instead. The pictures below are of Room 1209 which was the third room we moved to. On the last day we checked out and paid our charges in cash before leaving only to be told by the bank that they were trying to charge our credit card! You had the money, what the hell are you doing? A convenient part of this hotel and one of the reasons we booked it was they hold your luggage for you before you check in and out. It'll cost you a dollar per bag but God forbid you try and pay in coins! ""Unbelievable"" was the comment of the porter. This was an older porter too who we'd seen regularly. He even then went on to show his buddy who he was working with. Customer Service stinks and so do the rooms. If this is a 4 star hotel I'd hate to stay anywhere below that in NYC. They weren't in any hurry or look after us while moving rooms or looking after us when moving. Then to be spoken to like that after a week of not sleeping is just ridiculous! Tips are part of the norm in America and really I have no issue with that, but you've got to earn it. I work hard to earn that money before being expected to give it to someone just for doing their job badly! This hotel cost us £1400 for 4 nights plus $114 for taxes.",1,Snowy0230,Dec-19
490,"Bucket List
NYC Tour","My daughter and I stayed Dec.5th through 8th. We enjoyed our stay very much. Some complained about the small bathroom,  but we managed easily.  It's an historic hotel, bathrooms were small! Our room was spacious, with plenty of room. There was a band somewhere very close the first night, very noisy, couldn't sleep till they quit at 2 am. After that, it was peaceful and comfy the other nights. Breakfast at Friedman's was wonderful two of our mornings, though pricey.  The location couldn't be better, so close to Times Square, and Broadway shows right out the back door! We will try to stay again! Courteous and friendly staff.",4,Carolina_Lady,Dec-19
491,Good price Hotel for the location,Actually stayed there in August 2015 with my parents on their 1st trip to New York from Germany. Great central location and that at a reasonable price for NY city. Rooms were small but had all you need. Front desk was very helpful when we needed a fridge in our room for medications. Their weekly welcome party is great! Next time I'll go to NY I'll try to stay there again,4,Ohorn74,Aug-19
492,Excellent location,"We have just returned from a 3 night stay at the Edison. 6 ladies celebrating two birthdays. Location could not be better, I could see times square from my window, so could my sister. Room 1917 and 1919. Large rooms with two large beds and a good size bathroom a desk and two relax chairs. Dressing gowns, safe and umbrella in the wardrobe for you to use. The hotel is very clean and you could not get more friendly staff. The lifts are manned by security so it's very safe. Excellent luggage service for when you arrive and leave if your room is not ready or you have a late flight for just 1 dollor per bag they are stored in a sercure room.For breakfast we eat in Bond 45 and it was lovely. Opens at 7am so great if you need to be out early. I will defiantly return and my mum has stayed at this hotel 5 times before and always had a great experince. A special thanks to Rommel and this team for a pleasant stay at the Edison.",5,Stephanie G,Dec-19
493,AWFUL,"Stayed at this pit of a hotel in nowember 2019, the first room we were given stank, it had wallpaper peeling from the walls the bathroom was filthy, the bath had black marks all over it and the plug hole was rusty. The carpet was filthy and there was dirt and dust all round the skirting boards. Got the room changed but it wasn't much better. And now the credit card bill has come in and I think i have been charged for the room change even though when I chaecked out I was told there was no charges made to my credit card SO WHY WAS A CHARGE OF £67 MADE ON MY CREDIT CARD. Stay here at your own peril. Their web site says they are a 4 star hotel. I THINK NOT. 2 star yes but certainly not a 4 star.This by far is the worst hotel I have ever stayed in in New York. Have been many times and this SQUALID hotel needs a serious update and deep cleanAVOID THIS HOTEL !!!!!!!",1,Nessa2006,Nov-19
494,"Excellent location, service, amenities and history!","The Edison is a half block from Times Square and walking distance to everything. It can be quite busy in this area, but the hotel was fun and rooms quiet. The service staff was excellent, always helpful and pleasant. The Bond 45 restaurant had great ambiance and menu and an excellent veggie bar (try the fried cauliflower - to die for) and the Rum Bar was small, intimate and fun with live music. great way to end the day.Downside, the rooms are small, but clean and well laid out. Definitely will stay again",4,Gary A,Dec-19
495,"Great location, but needs updating","Hotel Edison is an older hotel at a great location near Times Square, but the rooms need updating and some repairs.  Beautiful lobby, great restaurants and the bar downstairs is awesome! While the room was clean, the bathroom was very small and the water faucet was very loose and sprayed water all over the wall. We traveled as part of a tour and some of the others we traveled with complained of mold in the bathroom and missing hair dryer or no closet. Sounds like every room may be a bit different, butt they could use some repairs and updating.",3,GM S,Dec-19
496,Poor decision,"After being recommended by our travel agent, this was the most disappointing Hotel we stayed at,Cramped rooms, heating you couldn't turn off, just old and dated. great location though. 50 Metres from Times Square. Not a Hotel I would recommend",2,Peter K,May-19
497,Second stay at Edison Hotel,"We came back to the Edison Hotel this year based on a very good experience last year. I’m happy to say we had another great experience. The hotel feels like a hometown place not an impersonal chain hotel. The beds are super comfortable and the staff are all super nice, so many went out of their way to be helpful, everyone was really sweet to my young daughter. Excellent location too! Two minutes walk to the heart of Times Square but it feels tucked away once you’re at the hotel. Room was a good size for NYC. We stay in the classic room which isn’t renovated because we like the value. Over all it’s a home run staying here!",5,Janine,Dec-19
498,"It's in the Closet: Helpful Staff, Amazing Location, Wicked Shower","Hotel Edison is a forever favorite of mine. I first stayed in '95 with my Theater class and was happy to come back as an adult to better appreciate it. We drove to NYC to see Betrayal on Broadway and Edison had a parking/room deal that made the whole thing effortless and appealing. Just pull up and go in. The Signature Queen room we stayed in was clean and stylish and overlooked the theater Hamilton was playing in; the views from there were amazing. You can't beat the location if you're there for the Theater District. Also, the amenities they provided were a nice touch. Need an umbrella? Lucky for you, it's in the closet! Need a robe and slippers? The closet. Need a luggage rack? It's in the closet. Dude, where's my safe? CLOSET! You could probably find Narnia in there but I didn't look because I was in the shower. I'm pretty sure they have the hottest water in NYC and it never seemed to run out, so if that's important to you, get in on it. The shower was gorgeously tiled and had plenty of room in it for myself and probably the entire cast of Cats, if I knew the entire cast of Cats (I don't, as it were).In conclusion, I would live here for the shower alone, and it's a home away from home when we come to the big city. I can't wait to stay again. (Sorry, I stole the room card-key -- I lost it in my gargantuan purse and the thought of dumping it out in the lobby seemed like a REALLY bad idea.)",5,Susan B,Nov-19
499,Great hotel in a great location ,My husband and I visited Hotel Edison in Dec 2019 for a quick weekend getaway. The location is perfect for walking! Centrally located and only a half a block off Times Square. We arrived early and it was very easy to leave our bags so we could explore before our rooms were ready. Rooms are clean and spacious for a hotel in Times Square. Beds were very comfy and shower was hot! Staff was courteous. We would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends!,5,Ashley R,Dec-19
