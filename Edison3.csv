0,"Great location, great hotel","My hotel of choice every time I go to New York is the Hotel Edison. It is steps away from Times Square, and the reason I go to New York is to gorge on theater performances. So Hubby and I can walk pretty much anywhere we want to go. I love the Art Deco (authentic, by the way) atmosphere, and the recent upgrades they've done in the rooms. Staff is very helpful and kind. We just love it.",5,SoCalTallGal,September 2019
1,Weekend getaway,"Excellent service, helpful staff.  Retro feel to the hotel yet modern rooms and amenities.  Hotel is close to the action of Times Square.  Very enjoyable stay. Will stay at the Edison again when I am in New York.",5,Kim B,September 2019
2,reliably clean and comfortable!,I have stayed here many times and have found it to be reliably clean and comfortable. The staff is great and makes every request possible. Check in and out are smooth. I find the onsite restaurants very good.  The rooms with a terrace are amazing!  A great value in a prime location near Times Square.,5,I4913PEpatrickl,September 2019
3,Girls trip,"Booked for  4 nights for double room in error by travel agents email in advance to request twin room had to wait till arrived for availability. Receptionist was rude said we would need to pay additional $20 per night we said no would take double bed, bad move room was tiny, dated and not suitable went back to reception got same person took twin room had to pay difference, this room not much better on 7th floor, small room 2 single beds, curtains dirty, hole in wall next to air conditioning machine, mismatched tiles in bathroom small cupboards to hang clothes. Dated furniture & wallpaper certainly not what you see when you look online.Only good point very close to Times Square. Would recommend booking other hotels in area.People smoking weed in rooms. Reported to reception following day.Disappointing stay, modern room photos are not all they seem.",2,Joyce F,September 2019
4,Danny OBrien made our trip spectacular at the  Edison.,"The time we spent at the Edison while visiting NYC from New  Zealand was amazing. What a beautiful city,  beautiful hotel and and amazing hotel staff. In particular Danny OBrien from Security. If not for Danny our trip would have been sadly ruined.  My daughter 3yrs old, was ill with high fever 102 temperature. We called the front desk for assistance and Danny OBrien from security was up within seconds. He was so amazing. As parents you are under total stress seeing your little girl in distress. Danny went into action as he was experienced later finding out trained as a detective.  He was so caring calming and relaxing  my wife and I down while keeping my daughter calm and  while immediately calling  911. He went into medic care holding my daughters hand and keeping her fever from raising any higher by keeping ice on her head. Medics arrived and took my and us in the ambulance to the hospital.   My daughter was treated wonderfully at the hospital and released the following morning. She was all better and cheerful, we couldn't of had a better time. What was even more special was when we all returned the following day we found  a teddy bear 🧸 coloring book, yo-yo, and big chocolate cookie inside room with business card Danny OBrien, Area Director of Security.  I travel all the time and never experience such loving caring treatment.",5,Sabrina55631,N/A
5,Just OK - Pluses & Minuses. ,"My girlfriends and I were on a charter bus trip from Ohio. We stayed 2 nights at Hotel Edison. First of all, the location in Times Square was great. Easy walking distance to many restaurants, shows & attractions. Since our tour company handled all the reservations & the checkin/checkout process, I had no interaction with the staff other than security staff, which were very friendly. You had to show your room key in order to get to the elevator to go to your room, so that made us feel safe & secure. We had breakfast both mornings in the restaurant and the food & wait staff was good. The downside was our room. Although the actual room was an adequate size, the bathroom was TINY!!  You could basically sit in the toilet, wash your feet in the bathtub and brush your teeth in the sink, all at the same time. I’ve been in RV’s that had bigger bathrooms! There is no way you could share the mirror with another in order to put on make-up or do your hair. There was mildew on the ceilings, the wallpaper was peeling and the furniture and baseboard/trim was old & beat up. Our room over looked the Barrymore Theatre. The windows were not very soundproof and we heard people at the theatre until 1:30 am. So bring your earplugs! I have no idea what the rate was for our room since we had an all inclusive package deal, but based on several booking sites, it was overpriced for the quality of the room.",3,AnnieG,October 2019
6,Room not so hot; Alex in security is awesome. :-),"After booking our room months in advance and entering the lovely lobby in the Hotel Edison, we were assigned a dingy, musty room on the twelfth floor. The wallpaper was peeling and mildewed; there was a strong odor of mold. The bathroom was stained.We requested a room change, which we were given. The second room was an improvement, but still not up to standard. The bathtub had nail polish stains, rust, and black stains all over it. It was also musty, albeit not as moldy-smelling as the first. Since we weren't going to spend a lot of time in the room, we didn't complain, but we would not recommend the Hotel Edison. Better off at a chain hotel where the rooms--even if not fancy--are consistent.HOWEVER . . . I left my tablet in my room. After jumping through a series of hoops, Alex Grullon (Security Manager) was extremely helpful and arranged to have it sent to me via FedEx. He and his security staff were professional, gracious, and patient after I tried about fifteen times to arrange the shipping and was about to lose my cool. His follow-up was prompt and pleasant.BOTTOM LINE: - Great lobby- Sub-par rooms- Fantastic security staff",2,Sugarfork,September 2019
7,Tired hotel but great location,This hotel is older and the rooms are nothing special.  The location is perfect if you want to be near time square and broadway.  The staff are not attentive and it takes many trips to the front desk to get service.  The phones in the room ring busy all day and night so have to walk down to the desk as you can’t reach them by phone.  Also their credit machines don’t always work and they don’t seem to recognize it is on there end hence making the guest feel inferior.  Once you get your room it is good.  The maids are great and the best part of the hotel staff.  This hotel is lucky where it is located,3,LuLu,September 2019
8,Ms,Our goal was to see NY in a week! The Edison Hotel is only a block from Times Square and we hung out there every day! Our standard room for two was clean and comfortable. The doorman helped us with transportation and the bellman answered many questions that we had. We were too busy to take advantage of the restaurant or the workout room but the location was so convenient to food and the subway that we didn’t need them. I already have recommended this hotel to my grandson.,5,Picadilly,September 2019
9,Times Square Gem,"Hotel Edison is right in the heart of Times Square. The location is great  to do all the things N.Y. has to offer. If your looking for a reasonable priced property this is the one. It’s a walking distance to Central Park,  5th Ave, many of the museums and Broadway theatre",4,yomojr,September 2019
10,The worst hotel room I have ever stayed in ,"The only positive about the hotel was its location. Our room was a classic twin queen bed room 1202, it was possibly the worst hotel room I have ever stayed in. The bathroom was small, with a patchwork of tiles where repairs have been done with whatever appeared to be available and the joinery was severely damaged. The room felt dirty and the air conditioning was so loud you could barely hold a conversation when it was on. We also experienced the smoke alarm being set off by the steam iron (surely the sensor was faulty) and had to endure the sound of the alarm for 30 minutes before a member of staff came to turn it off, without even an apology. There is no facility to make a cup of tea or coffee in the room nor is there a fridge / mini bar. The common areas are very deceiving as they are well kept and glamorous but once you enter your room it is another story and the rooms are not what you see on the hotel website or booking sites. Given that we paid over $400 per night I was extremely disappointed with the room, but the location couldn’t be faulted.",1,darylroots,September 2019
11,Mr Taylor ,"Stayed at the Edison on w228 47th and Broadway from 20/9/19 to 25/9/19 inclusive.Lovely friendly staff and great service.The room we were allocated on arrival wasn’t great,but I asked to change rooms to a recently refurbished room and it was great.The manager changed rooms for us without any hesitation and refunded some of the local taxes.The hotel is undergoing renovation at the moment and the rooms are being refurbished.Our stay was fantastic and the staff cleaners security etc were great.Security is tight in the hotel and no one can enter without showing your room key,which is great as you feel safe at all times.The location couldn’t be better.A 5 minute walk and your in Hell’s Kitchen or a 25 minute walk to 34th street and the Empire State or Maceys store.Had a great time and would definitely return in the future and would recommend this hotel to anyone,especially if it’s your first time in Manhattan.All in all a wonderful stay made even better by the staff.One more thing the lobby is beautiful as the hotel was built in the early 1930s and shows of the Art Deco period beautifully.",5,snookygkt,September 2019
12,Great choice!,"First time to NYC. Loved it ! Found Edison Hotel through Booking.com. Was very pleased with the choice. Staff extremely friendly and welcoming.  Hotel is in a great location. Steps away from Times Square and all the theatres. Also close to various transit options. Many other sites within walking distance as well.  Rooms are cozy, ours was un-reno’d but had everything we needed.  Great value for the price.",5,Karyn R,September 2019
13,Hotel Edison New & Improved,"My wife & I spent Sept. 16th to 22nd in New York City, celebrating her birthday.  It was my 16th trip to New York City, her 11th.  It marked the 8th time we stayed at the Edison.  We plan our itinerary while in New York City based from this hotel which is perfectly located in Times Square which is convenient to get to any other area of the city easily.  Even before any renovations, we felt like we were 'home' when we booked in.  The atmosphere throughout the property is always friendly and comfortable.  The staff is very accommodating & happy to help.  From the front desk to the bell boys to security to upper management, we always experienced co-operation and 'Only to glad to help' attitude.   No wonder we feel at home.  A wonderful young lady helped us to secure our boarding passes for the flight home.  This erased a ton of stress by us not having to complete this task in a crowded, chaotic boarding area.  Since our last visit 2 and a half years ago, the hotel has opened two world-class restaurants on the premises,  Friedman's and Bond 45.  We enjoyed dining and hospitality in each several times.     We are now home and homesick for the Edison.",5,yankee72017,September 2019
14,Wonderful New York experience,"We were 6 ladies traveling together, stayed together in the family suite which was amazing. The hotel has an amazing location, wonderful staff, especially one of the doorman which always provided us with a transportation for 6 people. We recommend the hotel fully!",5,Elísa,September 2019
15,Fantastic location ,"Fantastic location, very close to Times Square. Beautiful art deco interior.  Very clean with comfortable beds. The only thing to let it down were the very tired bathrooms,  definitely in need of renovation. Saying that, there was plenty of hot water and the shower was OK.",5,sarnclark,September 2019
16,Celebrate my 60th!,"New York City should be visited by everyone at least once.  So much to see, to do, to eat!  The Hotel Edison is CLOSE to everything; one block from restaurant row, Broadway, Times Square.  Also, the staff is so polite, helpful and I felt very safe which is important while staying in NYC!",5,Jules H,September 2019
17,New york Experience,Wonderfull experience with fantastic staff. Very clean and a great loaction for touring all the hot spots of New York. Beautiful food in the restaurant. Complimentary bottle of water in the room each day.,5,Sandra N,September 2019
18,Wonderful trip!,We had a fabulous stay at The Edison. Everyone there is so friendly and helpful. Our room was comfortable and plenty large enough for the 4 adults in our party.  We have stayed at The Edison many times before and have always been satisfied.  We will definitely be back.,5,Baseball fan,September 2019
19,Very outdated and grotty rooms.,"We booked this hotel as a package holiday back in May this year based on the pictures on the website and how lovely it looked. When the 21st Sept after a long wait at JFK. We were given our double room on the 11th floor. It was a very small, smelly and outdated room with a view of a brick wall, nothing like we thought we had booked.We complained and was offered another double room on the 10th floor. Although this room was a little bigger, it was dirty with paint peeling off the walls and ceiling, the closet was mouldy, so bad that we didn't hang our clothes in it and lived out of our suitcase. The bathroom was fit for purpose but the bath was so old and worn it looked like ground in dirt.We had no coffee machine in our room and no fridge as we had been sold. Again we complained and was offered either an upgrade to a superior room with 2 queen beds at $70 per night or a refund on the daily tax, a coffee machine and apologies from the staffWe Were advised that the double rooms are larger than most hotels in NYC. We've been in 2 other hotels in NYC in the past and the double rooms were twice the size and cheaper! Overall we came home very disappointed with the rooms and feel like we had been cheated on what we had booked and what we got.",2,Rebecca W,September 2019
20,Fantastic location,"2nd time in New York and wanted to stay in the time square area. This hotel is right on time square which is perfect for seeing all of Manhattan. It's a very busy hotel so took a bit of time to check in but not that bad about 20 mins. The staff were nice and friendly. The room was a signature room which was spacious and well equipped, bathroom was very small but no issues. There are facilities in the hotel 2x places to eat and a great bar which we really enjoyed. Especially with the 2 for one drinks vouchers!!!. The only complaint I have and it's not specifically to this hotel is the resort tax. I had fully paid for the hotel to then we told I have to pay another $25 per day. Just be aware. Overall great hotel and experience and would stay again.",5,Jamie L,September 2019
21,Great location but unsecured building. In this hotel they steal.,"In this hotel they steal, I don't know who, the management or houskeepers. We were in Edison hotel for a long weekend, we forgot to take the bracelet and neclace from the bathroom. Reported that immediately, know what and where we left exactly, I described it in more than 14 emails to the hotel management, for over a month I try to get any information and recover my things, nobody wants help or security or manager, the only answer from them is not there, or we checked the cameras ( somewhere in the bathroom ??). no one is responsible for the items left behind. I have to wait 2 weeks for an email reply from the manager. Suggestion, double check your baggage, if you leave something, you will never get it back again !!It was supposed to be a great weekend for my daughter before she went to college, the theft and lies from the management ruined everything. Waiting for a response from the manager again how long? who knows?",1,Katarzyna N,August 2019
22,Poor Service and noisy air conditioning ,"I’m in my room and physical old style air conditioner is extremely noisy. Spoke with the reception, they were sending someone to check it up. Which I don’t believe will change anything. For reminder have been trying to call without any response. Imagine  the reception and operator of hotel is not picking up the house phone. I wish I could post the video with noise. Regards",1,Tariq Malik,September 2019
23,Hotel Edison,"Located steps from Times Square, this hotel is the best choice.  Besides its location, the staff is very attentive.  One cannot not walk too far without being acknowledged with at least a simple 'hello' if not askong if you need assistance from a staff person.",5,Passenger563379,September 2019
24,Just back,"Just back from 5 night stay.Pros: Literally seconds walk from times sq and walking distance to alot of main attractions. Security 24/7 Housekeeping were lovely, even folded my nightdress every morning Staff happy to help when asked Qs Cons: Room was tiny , not alot of space for clothes. Air con didnt workVery noisy with construction going onRooms very dated and definitely in need of a serious upgrade. All in all we enjoyed our stay,its grand if all you need is a bed and shower. Didnt eat in so cant comment on food.",3,LauraRambo,September 2019
25,Staff and location are both amazing,"My family has stayed at the Edison many times over the years.  When booking our most recent trip I made a scheduling error and booked incorrect dates via a third party site.  Upon immediately realizing my error, and being told by third party that my hotel date was not able to be changed to match the flight I’d also booked with them, I called the Edison directly and was met with impeccable customer service.  Eric at the front desk was attentive, understanding and took immediate action to help me adjust my accommodations.  Customer service is becoming a lost art, but I’ve never found this to be true of the staff at the Hotel Edison.  Thanks ya’ll for making sure our family enjoys, yet another, memorable stay in the heart of NYC!",5,trishm172,August 2019
26,"Really poor accommodation for the price we paid, so disappointed.","First let me explain that we have stayed in hotels all over the world and this is the first time I have felt the need to take to this forum to express our views. We booked the Hotel Edison for my son's 21st birthday on personal recommendation by our local travel agent. Based on the photographs we saw on Triumph Hotels website  of the classic rooms, we paid $1933 to the Edison for 8 nights for 3 adults sharing room only, + $200 resort fees. Our first room 1537 was tiny, grubby and damp, the bathroom was horrendous, we asked at reception the next morning to move. Receptionist was very matter of fact, no apology. We moved to 706 to be honest it wasn't much better. The size of the bathroom, worn enamel, rust etc I wish I had brought bleach or detol from home with me. 2 nights later we heard water pouring through the bedroom ceiling, this obviously wasn't the first time this had happened by the blown plaster and peeling wallpaper. The water was pouring into the aircon unit which we couldn't use. We placed towels on the carpet which was soaking (probably where the damp smell was coming from) and over the unit. I reported this next morning to reception, again no interest shown. Someone must've been and looked at it as there was a big footprint on towel but it wasn't resolved, nor were we offered another room as they were ""full"". I can cope with shabby, characterful, but quite honestly the damp dingy rooms we saw were nothing like the rooms advertised. I approached our travel agent on our return. She was emailed and phoned the hotel, not one person has responded, and we have been offered no compensation.  I read on social media and on this forum that the rooms are wonderful and the staff go out of their way to help, we certainly didn't experience this. Where we just UNLUCKY? Gutted is an understatement as this was our first time in NYC and supposed to be a special trip, we're just glad we spent as little time as possible in the Hotel.",2,Donna W,June 2019
27,ate at Friedman's,"stopped here because we were looking for something near the theater, and they advertised gluten free foodthe restaurant is part of the hotel & not partsat at the counter, because there was a wait for tables & boothswe had eggs-one w chicken sausage & the other w slab baconboth came w potato hash ( which was unseasoned & bland)but everything else was fresh, well prepared & tasty",4,leo t,September 2019
28,Leisure,Perfect location Perfect services Perfect employees Perfect room All was very good Times square is just at 50m Metro also too.  I fully recommend. I’ll be back for sure Thank you again to the Hotel Edison,5,Salena Tekle,September 2019
29,New York New York,"We came here on a family holiday and had 2 rooms, one queen and one family room. We stayed here for 3 nights and couldn’t really fault the hotel unless we wanted to be very picky.The location is great, you can walk to Times Square in less than 1 minute. You are greeted at the door by a very polite door man. Hotel is very secure, must show key card to enter the lifts/stairs, security everywhere. (Feels very safe).The rooms are a little dated, but they are perfect for what you need them for, as in New York you are too busy to be spending all day in the rooms. They are clean, daily housekeeping and large bathroom. We had a rather dull view however my parents had a great view of the street.The hotel has its own 2 or 3 restaurants, which we only used once during our stay for breakfast which was great. The staff couldn’t have done more for you, however expensive. If you are looking for a cheaper alternative there is a Starbucks directly over the road. We would like to pay a massive thanks to the concierge. On our flight out one of our cases was lost. We passed all info onto the concierge who sorted this for us, and then brought the case to our room upon arrival.For the price you cannot fault this hotel.",5,Lucy Blacker,November 2018
30,"Very Disappointed,  do not book to stay here","How very very disappointed,  player alot of money to stay and have been planning this trip for months.I previously emailed the hotel to request a nice room for my parents and I as we was celebrating birthday's and anniversary. When my husband and I walked into the room i was shocked, the wall paperwork was ripped, carpet fraying,  room dark and dingy.The enamble coming of the bath, but it looked like they had painted the bath with a coating to stop it from getting worked.Paint flaking of the ceils and inside of the wardrobe. Only 3 pillows on the bed between 2 people.  There was a Loud noise from outside which I could only explain came from extractors fans,  there must have lots of these which continued day and night. We was on the 11th floor, the noise kept me aware all night. The view was terrible,  looking at brick building.I went to reception and complained, they said we could change to another room the following day which we agreed to do.I packed the suitcases again and the following day we move. OMG it was just as bad.Really bad decoration, even less cupboard space, there was no chest of draws. The noise outside was just as bad. In the end i had to buy some ear Plugs to use during the night so i could get some sleep. I kindly asked one of the house maids for an extra pillow which they kindly gave me.My parents who was also staying in the hotel complained about the state of their room, my parents was shown 5 differant rooms which they said was all the same so therefore wasn't worth moving as my mom is disabled and the packing of the suitcases would have been too much for them.The only postive thing was the maids was very good.The whole hotel needs either to be rebuilt or definitely needs refrurbishing.DO NOT STAY HERE, SPEND YOUR MONEY ELSE WHERE.My sister in law stayed at the Crown Plaza at the same time and her room was lovely. The photographs do not give a true reflection,  the room was a lot worked.The hotel charge a report fee for each night you stay, i think they should disregard this fee and they should be paying the customers for staying in the first place.I gave a 1 star but should be a negative star rating as it doesn""t deserve the 1 star.Honestly do not WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY. M",1,sandrakay83,September 2019
31,Disappointing Like a dumpy dorm room,"My diSappointment is with my room  I expected small—the standard for space in Times Square is lower than average   But I didn’t expect the mattress to sag to the floor when I sat on it, or for the room to be lit only by 3 light bulbs one of which is broken. It’s dusty too—the write-in kind. Sigh. The location and public spaces are great. But I don’t want to sleep in my nostalgia literally. Just be reminded of it  Wish I was at the W next door",2,Sandra M,September 2019
32,"Friendly, helpful, perfect!","I've stayed in the Hotel Edison twice now with a third stay booked for Thanksgiving 2019. The staff are so friendly and personable, especially considering how busy the hotel can be during check-in times! During a stay in 2017 we realised on arriving our first evening that our travel agent had requested the wrong room type. As it was late there wasn't much that could be done but first thing the following morning we were moved to the right room. The hotel staff were so accomodating even though it was no fault of their own, even keeping us on the same floor as our friends room. I've booked directly since and have had no issues. Both times we made requests by email, when booking indirectly and directly, and both times our requests were granted. I'm sure it will be the same with any future stays.The hotel is in the middle of everything with Times Square practically on your doorstep. There are so many attractions within walking distance and subway stations close by when you want to venture further.The restaurants and bars in and around the hotel are brilliant and staff are so helpful with any tips or suggestions, if needed.With such a beautiful art-deco interior, amazing staff (from the doorman, concierge/front desk to bell boys and maid service) I honestly can't find a fault. We are so looking forward to our next trip to Hotel Edison, with many more to follow!",5,Sinéad Kavanagh,October 2018
33,Typical city hotel,Nothing special the stay was basic. Old room with no view very dated bathroom and the safe broke! Not a great hotel but the location was good just around corner from times square. Taxi was easy to get outside and the bar was good.,2,missrachelgreen,September 2019
34,Really bad start!,"Just checked in tonight, having booked well in advance. Was really careful about booking Kingsize rooms for the three nights. When getting to the rooms, not at the reception, we realised that our pre-paid kingsize room had been changed to a queensize because “there are no kingsize rooms available”! What a lousy service! They obviously knew we were coming and the whole point of booking in advance and not just show up at the hotel and asking for a room is that you actually can decide where to stay and what type of room you want to pay for!They say that the rooms we have paid for should be available tomorrow. I’ll see it before I believe it!",1,Jelgren,September 2019
35,Women traveling to NYC alone - The HotelEdison is the place for you!,I often travel to NYC on business alone. I have stayed at some of the best know hotels and choose The Hotel Edison because I am treated like a person not a number.The service is wonderful. From the reception staff and security to the doormen who so graciously help with travel tips and taxis.Freidmans and the Rum House are adjacent and create a comfortable enviorment for a person traveling alone.I always reserve a room or suite with a terrace. They are the perfect size and offer a great view.Dont miss the beautiful night lounge at Bond 45. It was designed by the Hamilton set designer and is a secret sancutary to the theatre crowd - a must see.,5,Karen C,September 2019
36,Poor Dated Rooms and Rude Staff,"We stayed in New York for a week and booked this hotel 7 months ago, we had the price confirmed as $1335.16 plus taxes $217.93 total = £1553.09 to be collected by the hotel. Tex on the front desk tried to add an additional $200 dollars (I know this is this extortion and they call it a resort fee) I refused to pay as on our invoice it clearly stated all taxes and fees included. I explained that I was not going to argue with him now as we had just started our holiday but we would have a conversation when we check out. The following week when we checked out he still tried to apply this fee and I asked to speak to the manager who eventually removed this fee. On the subject of resort fees what is that all about? Wifi, Gym, Newspaper etc is normally part of the hotel service!! He told us that he had given us a nice newly refurbished room, NOT! The room was tiny, carpets smelled and air conditioning unit in the room was like a lawn mower! So loud. The cleaners were very good and our bed was nice and fresh with ample toiletries  in the TINY bathroom. The tiles on the wall were from 1931, I am sure. We could not lock the bathroom door as it had been painted so many times you could not turn the lock.",1,ColinJames-UK,September 2019

38,"Poor quality hotel and disappointed , building & construction works ongoing.","Very disappointed with the hotel and room, we booked a signature room and after checking in had to change 3 times, the rooms were small, suffered from loud and noisy air con units, smell on the hall way of someone smoking and also smoking dope/weed/drugs. Also we found out they were renovating and when we booked not advised, woke up to noise and a man outside our window this morning (picture attached) we are on 22nd floor, sounded like they are coming through the roof. The lady on reception never advised of construction works when checking in. This really is unsatisfactory and it should be Clear then people have a choice to book or not. The hotel is very tired and loud. Not for anyone who wants a quite hotel. Anyone who wants Wifi, it's so slow, and again (picture attached) they advise they are upgrading WiFI , the lady never told us this either at check in. There are other friends staying at this hotel and all in all the group has spent over: $10,000, not a word of thanks, help to upgrade to sort rooms or any refund as a good will gesture. All they kept doing was offering other rooms were they were all as bad as the previous allocation. I eork in the industry and will not recommend this hotel.On a good point clean bed, sheets, shower etc, and maids cleaning room pleasant and nice.",2,Vivrow,September 2019
39,NYC - BIG BITE - GREAT STAY!,"My son and I took the trip and trying to find a hotel room with 2 beds wasn't as easy as I imagined.  I searched for locaiton (which I knew nothing of NYC) and amentiies as some of our top searches. Check in - easy. Elevators fast. Cleanliness - wonderful. Noise in room - minimal. Beds comfortable. Bathroom - clean - Water pressure in the shower and heat - OMG fantastic - especially after a long day!  AC never moved the setting and had the window cracked open!  Edison Hour - was a great time to meet people, plenty of food and wine!   Walking Tour - we did the one from the Belleclaire since the timing was right - and it was exceptional.  They held our luggage for $1 a piece when we checked out at 8 am until we could pick it up.  Very close to times Square - noise was minimal - we were there from Sunday-Wednesday though.  Close to Broadway plays, subway a little further - 42nd street was closed for a few of those days.  Walked to most everything!  GREAT!!!",5,LodiChris,September 2019
40,Was so bad it was hilarious,"We arrived after a long flight and hours getting through security to finally arrive at what looked a bit disappointing. The check in was very smooth and staff friendly considering the lobby was a bit chaotic. We were a party of 7 here to celebrate my sisters 50th Birthday. We got our keys and went to our rooms all on different floors. I walked into our room 1543 which was like stepping back in time. Paper had been replaced on the back of the door and didn't match the rest of the wall. The furniture was so tired and dated with chunks of wood missing. The carpet was very worn and lifting, the bathroom had tiles that had been replaced again that didn't match there was some sort of heater / cooler that looked like something from a museum. It was THE Worst hotel I have ever stayed in. We had 3 rooms and each of us had the same ecoetience. Apparently that's because our travel agent only booked classic rooms, which hadn't been renovated. This seems to be something that the hotel does. Put you in a bad room so that you will pay for an upgrade. My sister was charged an extra $200 before tax for her upgrade from room 1204 to room 1622 which was nicer, however the workmanship even on the upgrade was of very poor quality. We all changed rooms to what can only be described as a slight improvement. Thank goodness they have the location as they certainly don't have anything else!!!! Staff were very good in particular Christina who was there on 12/09 when we arrived, and arranged all the changes. However, since I have been home I have noticed several pending transactions on my credit card bill from this hotel, attempting to take £400 plus from my card. I have emailed twice and still haven't had a response.Sadly I would not recommend this hotel, its very dated and ever time we walked past reception there seemed to be someone else complaining about the state of their room. Very sad as its a great location with some great staff, but the hotel needs some serious investment with much better quality tradesmen to bring the rooms up to habitable standard as I wouldn't put my dog in the the first room we were given.",1,Michelle W,September 2019
41,Perfect location!,We stayed at Hotel Edison for 3 nights. The location is absolutely perfect. Times Square is just steps away and the hotel is close to subway stations that can take you to all the attractions and other parts of the city. Our hotel room was a bit small and dated but nice and clean. The staff is friendly and helpfull. There was much less city noise than I expected. There is a 'room key security check' in front of the elevator which makes you feel safe and secure.,4,Raoul Vincent,September 2019
42,Intoxicated by the lights of Times Square.,"Great hotel and location, polite staff especially lady Loredana.Good starting point to go around Manhattan on foot. Lovers of Broadway theatres are on the right place as a starting point. Kindly recommendation for the hotel.",5,Jack_Sparrow007,September 2019
43,"Overrated, overpriced","This hotel is completely overpriced and overrated. Staff are rude. After paying for my stay in full before arrival, I then had to pay an extra $200 for “incidentals” and city tax. When I informed Juan at reception that I had already paid the city tax, I got treated with such a lack of respect that I left the case and wasn’t bothered arguing. He didn’t inform me how much he was even taking out of my account when he took my card. I had to check my online banking to find out that it’s $100 for incidentals. He then went on to have an argument with another member of staff who approached him at the desk mid check in. It was embarrassing and uncomfortable for us. The rooms are tiny and nothing at all what they look like in the photos. We’re constantly tripping over our suitcases. The windows are not sound proof so you can hear every noise on the street. The hotel are doing construction at the moment and this is right outside our bedroom window so I have to keep the blinds closed at all times as I have seen workers looking into our room. We’re woken at 7am with the noise of this every morning. The cleanliness of our room is debatable with stains on the sheets, marks on the walls and hairs in the bathtub. Cleaning staff come in every day but I’m not quite sure what they do besides rake rubbish out and throw the covers back up on the bed. Be prepared to queue for long periods of time for check in and check out. They don’t do anything to try speed the process up for guests. The only good thing about this hotel is it’s convenient location in Times Square. Other than that it is a complete rip off and deeply upsetting when you spend so much money to stay here and then be treated with such disrespect. I wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,Anonymous,August 2019
44,Good room after getting what we paid for! ,"First all, let’s get the negative out the way. On arrival our room wasn’t ready, and instead of telling us, we were palmed off with a smaller room we hadn’t booked. It was dreadful with wall paper coming off the wall and a crack in the sink. Swiftly down to reception and faith was quickly restored and a staff member apologised for his colleagues mistake. New room sorted! If they had just told us our room wasn’t ready from the off, we’d of been happy to wait.Now onto the positives - the new room was good and one of the refurbed rooms on the  top 22nd floor. Fantastic views and a good standard finish to the room. Only gripes were the lack of storage space for clothes; we lived out of cases for 5 days and the aircon was very loud. A nice touch was the free bottled waters in the room everyday and decent Wi-fi!Location, location, location - couldn’t ask for more in the heart of time square. So much in walking distance e.g. Central Park, Top of the Rock, Empire State, 5th Avenue and of course Broadway! Also only a 10 to 15 minute Subway to Downtown for WTC, Wall street and the ferry for the Statue of Liberty. The staff were all very friendly and security by the lifts were good for checking only residences were going in the lifts.   On the whole a good hotel if you get one of the refurbed rooms.",4,JMSut1,September 2019
45,Valentine's,"We stayed at the Edison hotel for Valentine's, it was a very lovely hotel and our room was huge. I wouldn't hesitate to stay again, we also found security was very thorough which made us feel very secure.",4,Laurajc99,February 2019
46,Lovely hotel fantastic staff,"We stayed at the Hotel Edison from 24th/29th August 2019It was a birthday gift for my 50th birthday. We booked through hays travel so all taxes were included we requested a high room as we were told these had been newly redecorated. On arrival we were asked if we would like to upgrade our rooms but u fortunately we had 2 rooms booked so we could not afford to do this.The lovely lady on reception, Justyna, was so lovely helping us with check in answering our 100 questions with no hesitation, so as a token of thank you I gave her a box of chocolates and as our rooms would not be ready for a while we took a seat in the reception area. Justyna Said we would be upgraded, as our rooms would not be ready for a while, I was so grateful as we were so tired.Justyna and all the reception staff were so lovely. The hotel great with lovely rooms our room had a safe, coffee facilities, water hairdryer and lovely comfortable beds we only got one dressing robe which was a pity as my husband wanted one too. The hotel was in a great location just off Times Square behind the red steps. I would definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking to visit New York",5,Gillian L,August 2019
47,Chairman,"A great hotel and a grate atmosphere from the staff. And Hemlatta Singh, the maid, made me feel so welcome with her smile and comments through out my stay every day. It was so relaxing after a long day or refreshing into the day meeting her in the corridor.",5,vallisport,September 2019
48,Poor Quality Standard Rooms ,"We booked this hotel from Co-op Travel. Arrived at the hotel and was put in room 1204. Took one look and nearly fainted is was so disgusting. The room was dirty. Dubious stains all over the bathroom door which had chunks missing out of it and a leaking ceiling! The bath was chipped with plug holes full of dirt and hair. The main room had damp frayed carpets, cobwebs and the wallpaper peeling off most of the walls. I’ve honestly seen better Blackpool hostels than this room. I immediately complained as it was a family celebration! Incidentally all my family had awful rooms and mine was the better one! The hotel did upgrade me and my family but we all had to pay extra for this. It was worth it though. 2 members of staff were excellent Christina and Justina. They really did work hard to find all my family better rooms. If you book this hotel I think you’d be very disappointed in it. The hotel dated back to the 1930’s and I don’t think a lot of the rooms have had much decor since!!! If you book make absolutely sure you have a refurbished room or you’ll be very disappointed. We have complained to Co-Op Travel too as the hotel and rooms look nothing like the ones they advertised so please be warned re this. The plus sides are the two staff members I mentioned above and the location is fantastic. In the heart of Times Square and close to everything you’d ever need in New York. New York is fantastic! 🇺🇸",1,Deborah B,September 2019
49,Double thanks ,"Probably the largest hotel we've stayed in but having a small room. However very clean, great bed, decent bathroom. Room safe and good tv for chilling out time after a hard day's exploring NY. Friendly, helpful staff and great location. Having been left high and dry by our super shuttle service after check out , standing outside with the clock ticking and the great possibility of missing our flight what do we do?The hotel valet's buddy offered to take us to JFK airport in his awesome Chevrolet suv and as he promised after great driving through  horrendous  NY traffic conditions as well as a guided tour of Queens  along the way we managed to check in with only minutes to spare. A very big thank you my friend may all your dreams come true!Never got your name cos of the stressful time, Sorry. Gracias again !!",4,ICEDEVIL,September 2019
50,"Great location, great service, great room; just great!!!",Great location; can easily get to Times Square and all Broadway shows; great dining in the hotel and nearby! Great service; the front desk was very responsive and service was excellent. Great room; size was ok and bathroom was reasonable.,5,JIH,August 2019
51,Great location for action,"We took a shuttle to and from the airport and they drop you right at the front door.  The hotel is just off Times Square so it's easy to walk to many attractions, food, shopping.  There are many theaters in this area so there are plenty of people walking around at night.  I liked that our hotel was not on Times Square for the noise and sirens.  There is a restaurant in the hotel and entrances on both sides of the hotel which can save you walking around the block.",5,Barbara P,August 2019
52,Return trip - shambolic ,"So our trip took place in 2017 and at the time we were promised an upgraded room and a free night stay when we next returned so we felt it was fair they tried to resolve, however after 3 emails, phone calls and various other types of contact with no response trying to get them to book this for us I want to share our shambolic stay at Hotel Edison as it’s clear this offer wasn’t genuine and must have been to try and prevent us from sharing our experience. We stayed here from Monday 7th - 13th Aug. My husband had booked this as a surprise trip for my birthday and had booked the Edison as this is where we had stayed for our honeymoon 2 years prior and we love the hotel. Unfortunately our second trip has left us rather disappointed and we are very unlikely to stay here again. When we checked in we were given a ""Queen Room"" on the 22nd floor which had a bed so small it would not  comfortably sleep my 6ft 5 husband and I. Our room at home has a UK double and it is larger that this ""Queen"" also the plug gave electric shocks, the toilet would not flush properly and there was nowhere to storage suitcases - not ideal for a 6 night holiday! The next morning we were moved rooms and the receptionist was very apologetic saying it was one of the smallest rooms in the hotel!!We then were moved to a room on the 20th floor which was great and just like the queen we had stayed in previously. However, we were bothered throughout the night by people using the ice machine - while I have no issue with this I do think it is unacceptable at 4am as it is so noisy. We were also woken daily at 8am by renovations happening despite there being no notice advising of this work. At one point part of the ceiling fell down seconds after we passed and were waiting at the lift!! The final straw was when we were woken at midnight by a strange creaking sound. My husband sat up in bed and the headboard fell on top of his head!!!! This had been attached with 4 screws and had not correctly been fitted to the wall with plugs. There was also several holes in the wall which suggests the 4 screws had been drilled back in a number of times. I called reception 15 times and it was engaged every time I tried so I ended up having to go down in my pyjamas!! Security were very helpful and attended to my husband and checked we were ok. They wanted us to switch rooms, however I hope you can understand that at midnight the thought of packing our bags for a second time was very unappealing!!! We were also concerned we would end up back in a small room. Then housekeeping came to remove the headboard. We were just settling back to sleep when maintenance came to look at it despite us not having the headboard in our room anymore. Then at 8am 3 members of staff came to look at the problem and again were unaware of the headboard being removed! During that day the headboard was fixed back to the wall,  however we were rather disappointed that no one came to check we were happy about things or apologise for the inconvenience. I had hoped to discuss this issue at checkout but we weren't asked how our stay was. I have to say I'm very surprised at the events during our stay as it is not the same standard we expected following our honeymoon stay. My advice is do not stay here!",1,MissB8888,September 2019
53,all good at the Edison!!,"Friendly staff that greeted me with a smile and a big hello...the accommodations were spacious with lots of room for hanging clothes and a bureau....love their restaurants which were open late with great dinner and breakfast selections ....spacious, clean room",5,Rich W.,September 2019
54,Another wonderful visit!,"I had a great summer visit to the Hotel Edison in August.  As always, the staff was attentive to any and all guest needs. I stayed in a junior suite and was impressed with the cleanliness of the room and the attention to detail. The two beautiful restaurants in the hotel enhance the experience.  Great food, lovely ambience.  Can’t find a better location for a NYC visit if you love seeing Broadway shows!I love the energy in the hotel and will be back in the fall. Excellent staff.... beginning with doormen and continuing inside. Great hospitality.   Thanks for another enjoyable stay.",5,gm14142017,August 2019
55,gillian brighouse west yorkshire,"Recently just arrived home from a 3 night stay at the Hotel Edison. This hotel was so convenient to every thing we needed, and only seconds away from Times Square and broadway. The hotel itself was a bit dated and the room we were in was quite small but was not a problem as we weas only sleeping there. Hemlatta Singh who cleaned our room was very friendly and nothing was too much trouble for her.  All the staff we had dealing with was all very polite and helped us with any questions we asked.If I ever return to New York in the future  I would definably stay here..Would 100% recommend this hotel to anyone thinking of a stay in New YorkGillian CoreWest YorkshireEngland",4,gilliancore,September 2019
56,Only location is good.,"Old hotel with old furniture and old facility, I stuck in elevator once for 10 minutes. They ask for my name and room number said they will contact me later. But no one call me before I check out.Front desk are always busy and show poker face to every customers. I called for a missing trash bin but no response all day.老舊的大樓，我還曾經被困在電梯間裡面。服務人員事後要我留下姓名與房號，說會有人聯繫我，可是一直到我退房時都沒有。前台永遠忙碌，總是要排隊等候，前台人員總是板著臉沒有好臉色。清潔人員居然將浴室垃圾桶取走，我打電話去要求補充卻沒有任何回應。",2,Jet,September 2019
57,"Location & price earn the 5 stars, but desperately needs some renovation","I was debating between 4 and 5 stars, but location and price must bump it up.  My wife and I got a babysitter and decided to have a Staycation in the city after our dinner and show.  I found Hotel Edison on TripAdvisor mainly because the location is a block or so from all the main shows and because it 47th and not an Ave the pricing was way less.The hotel itself could use some renovations as the age is starting to go from post-modern to just plain old.  The bathroom is the most evident room where this renovation should take place.The staff was friendly and knowledge.  The hotel was clean, which is of course the most important elements when choosing a place to sleep.After some renovations this is a no-brainer 5 star hotel.",5,psudino,June 2019
58,Dated but ckean,"The lobby and common areas are very nice, clean and modern. The room is clean but dated. Bed is comfortable. Room was quiet given the location. Staff very pleasant and helpful. Good value for the money.",4,Sunrise Seeker,September 2019
59,Amazing location,"We stayed here as part of our honeymoon in the USA. Check in was quick and straight forward. We stayed in a basic double on the 11th floor. The room was very small which is expected from a hotel is central. The bathroom is in need of a bit of modernising but was clean enough. The Aircon unit came in very handy on hot days but was far too noisy to keep on overnight. My only real issue was the lack of light near to a mirror to do my hair and makeup, when the bathroom mirror was steamed up.The location was absolutely perfect and so easy to find. Didn't eat at any of the restaurants as they're a little pricey compared to some of the less-central places. We did have a drink at the Rhum bar but after tipping, 2 drinks cost is about $35, which you'd never expected to pay in the UK. However, the bartender was ace and live jazz music was great! Overall, a good place to stay if you want to be in the thick of it. Would recommend!",4,Sarah Coyne,September 2019
60,Perfect Get Away,"My boyfriend and I went to NYC for a quick get away and stayed at the Edison for 1 night.  The location of this hotel is amazing, literally just off Times Square.  We were checked in by Cristain, who was welcoming and gracious.  Our room was on the 17th floor with a great view.  The guest room was clean and well appointed BUT the bathroom...can't say enough about it.  Not sure if it was recently remodeled but it is gorgeous and I left with serious shower envy :)Want to send an extra thanks to Roger, one of the hotel's managers who gave us a ""local's"" suggestion for dinner, as we didn't want anything too touristy and made sure we were enjoying our stay.  It really was a perfect get away! Next time I think 2 nights maybe??  We will definitely be back!",5,Kimme,September 2019
61,A good hotel stay ,"We had an accessable signature room with 2 Queen beds and a wet floor shower. The beds were comfortable and the shower pressure was good with plenty of hot water.  The security was good, you have to show your room key to get into the lifts. The public areas are beautiful in an art Deco style. The bar (the Rum House) only played jazz which isn't my thing so we never went in. The only negatives were that we had a tiny closet which was hidden with an ironing board and no drawer space. We lived out of our suitcase for 5 days as there was no space for our belongings but we had a wonderful time in New York.",4,Brenda F,September 2019
62,Great hotel lovely staff,"Just left the Edison today after a 6 night stay. Everything was perfect! Do not be put off by the bad reviews. This hotel has comfy beds, coffee machines in each room, bathroom quite small but ample for what was required. Breakfast portions huge. Clean rooms and linen changed and towels changed as often as you want. Best thing about the hotel is the doorman Bobby. If you need to know anything about anything ask Bobby we really enjoyed our morning chats with him,and bringing him a coffee. Thanks Bobby from the 3 Scots!

63,Ideal Location ,"Hotel is on a side street just off Times Square, it's a 2 minute walk. Rooms are comfortable if a little basic but are ideal for a busy New York break. There are delis nearby for the NY breakfast experience.As a base for a shopping/sightseeing trip the hotel is perfect.",4,Dorothy Plane,March 2019
64,NYC Weekend,Hotel Edison was very accommodating and location was ideal for a 1st time tourist to the city. Found the hotel management friendly and responsive to our needs and requests. Especially helping us plan the best way to navigate the city. Room was comfortable and bathroom on the small side. Three ladies staying in one room and only one mirror in the bathroom made it difficult to get ready. I would recommend the hotel.,4,Candice T,September 2019
65,Not what I expected ,"Booked this through TUI and it looked lovely. Read some bad reviews beforehand and put it to the back of my mind. We arrived about 6pm after a long long drag at immigration at JFK. Check in was OK, fairly smooth. Had our bags taken to our room. The room, well it wasn't the best! The size was OK but it was really outdated and there was paint coming off the wall, the bathroom door was almost in bits with wood missing and the bathroom cabinet had slash like marks and rust everywhere. It was fairly clean, some dust around the bed and the woodwork. No view, the noise from Times Square was pretty loud and the flickering lights shone into the room which was a bit of an issue. After a long day of travelling we just put our heads down and tried to sleep. Lack of pillows was a problem, we had 3, but we did get another one when requested in about 30 minutes so that was good.If you want to be super close to Times Square and don't mind noise and if you aren't fussed on a modern room then this is a good hotel. $25 per night for a ""resort fee"" is crazy then when we asked to have our baggage kept behind after check out we were charged $1 per bag! Never have I had that before and I've travelled a lot!Overall the staff were nice and if you like Times Square it's a good base but I was quite disappointed.",2,Charlotte J,September 2019
66,Generally Good,"If you want to be extremely close to Times Square the location cannot be better.Staff/service was a high point with helpful and friendly people.  This is a popular and busy hotel.  Check-in went quickly and smoothly.  The art deco interior is attractive, well decorated and nicely maintained.  Our double (two queen beds) room was of good size for an older city hotel with useful furnishings and reasonable storage.  The bath was very small but usable with hot water delivered quickly and steadily.  The mattresses were very firm but lacked cushioning.  Accustomed to memory foam it took me much longer than usual to go to sleep.The windows have both light-filtering and light-blocking roll-up shades--a nice touch.  Our 10th floor room faced 47th street and it was quite noisy at times during the night.  Strangely I was woken each night around 1:00 a.m. or so by what sounded like a jet flying very low with the sound continuing for minutes.  Normally sounds do not wake me but this one was unusual.  The ordinary type individual cooling/heating system worked well but was a bit noisier than average.  Rear-facing rooms [may] be quieter.My one experience in the restaurant, a pastrami Reuben, was extremely good.  Food and drink prices are rather high.",4,SwampeastMike,September 2019
67,Given lower room type from marketed,"I booked from agoda. Booked the Junior Suite King with photos of the room showing a decent sized room with kind bed and sofa set opposite it including good space between the two and coffee table.

I informed the hotel reception and showed the photo from my purchase but the reception said it is agoda who did false marketing with wrong photos. Saying that the posted photos belongs to Signature Junior Suite King while agoda booked me on classic junior suite king. However I go online to compare even the current moment on agoda there is only Junior suite king without any differentiation of classic or signature and all photos referencing to this room type  is the same one that I saw and book. But hotel seems to be playing with words. While the hotel blame agoda saying its false marketing on agoda side. And agoda in turn says it’s the hotel that post the photos, I am more incline to believe agoda because the hotel reception refused to speak to agoda over the phone. 8 hours on and the issue is still not resolved.

As we arrived at 7 am, we came to the reception for check in and we’ve been told we can only check in on 3pm, or we can pay extra 70 dollars and check in on 11am, we refused her offer and left until 3pmWhen we came back at 3pm we checked in and got a room that was pretty small. We had no mini refrigerator although it said on the website we booked from that there is.We tried to turn off the AC but it stayed on, and we got one big bed (although we wrote 2 beds) , we called 5 times to the reception without answer so we went there . The guy from the reception told us he will send his colleague in 20 minutes, we waited more than 50 minutes, the guy that came turn the AC off and left .  Meanwhile we asked house keeping for 2 single blanket instead of the double blanket we had, and few shower capsWe had a really long day (after a 12 hours flight and 8 hours wondering around the streets of Manhattan) and we just wanted to take a shower.We called 4 times to house keeping and each time we got the same answer that they already sent someone. After 35 minutes we got few shower cap but still no blankets so we called again and got old blankets that my sister is allergic to . We called again and asked for another kind. We went for another walk in the city  and when we got back we found out that we have towels instead of blankets the lady in housekeeping told us this is the blanket they have.  We told her we wanted the same blanket we already have on the bed but for single size so she laughed at us and said it’s not a blanket its a duvet. Finally  at 9 PM we got another blanket and we were able to go to sleep after a long day.I don’t  recommend this hotel at all keep your distance of it don’t go there we paid too much money and we got so little I am very disappointed",1,Noa Moalem,September 2019
69,Good location ,"I was visiting New York for the first time in 20 years to catch up with some old friends so I have to say first of all, excellent location, very central and steps away from Times Square and within easy reach of subway stations. Fantastic and friendly housekeeping staff and the security at the elevators was very reassuring. I had booked one of the older classic rooms so I knew it would be basic, however the room was a decent size, the bed was very comfortable, the shower pressure was good and the toiletries were very good and I had asked for a coffee machine for my room which was brought up as soon as I checked in. There were also outlets for charging phones etc and the WiFi was good. The downside was the room was very tired with chips in the woodwork and the bathroom had worn tiles and the bath was stained. The only view was the rooms opposite and the air conditioning was extremely loud so it was difficult to sleep. My main issue was the smell at various times during the day, which did put a downer on my stay somewhat.",3,Helen,July 2019

Meanwhile we asked house keeping for 2 single blanket instead of the double blanket we had, and few shower capsWe had a really long day (after a 12 hours flight and 8 hours wondering around the streets of Manhattan) and we just wanted to take a shower.We called 4 times to house keeping and each time we got the same answer that they already sent someone. After 35 minutes we got few shower cap but still no blankets so we called again and got old blankets that my sister is allergic to . We called again and asked for another kind. We went for another walk in the city  and when we got back we found out that we have towels instead of blankets the lady in housekeeping told us this is the blanket they have.  We told her we wanted the same blanket we already have on the bed but for single size so she laughed at us and said it’s not a blanket its a duvet. Finally  at 9 PM we got another blanket and we were able to go to sleep after a long day.I don’t  recommend this hotel at all keep your distance of it don’t go there we paid too much money and we got so little I am very disappointed",1,Noa Moalem,September 2019
74,Good location ,"I was visiting New York for the first time in 20 years to catch up with some old friends so I have to say first of all, excellent location, very central and steps away from Times Square and within easy reach of subway stations. Fantastic and friendly housekeeping staff and the security at the elevators was very reassuring. I had booked one of the older classic rooms so I knew it would be basic, however the room was a decent size, the bed was very comfortable, the shower pressure was good and the toiletries were very good and I had asked for a coffee machine for my room which was brought up as soon as I checked in. There were also outlets for charging phones etc and the WiFi was good. The downside was the room was very tired with chips in the woodwork and the bathroom had worn tiles and the bath was stained. The only view was the rooms opposite and the air conditioning was extremely loud so it was difficult to sleep. My main issue was the smell at various times during the day, which did put a downer on my stay somewhat.",3,Helen,July 2019
75,"An older hotel with smaller rooms; tastefully decorated, nice bathroom, all clean","It came recommended by my sister. A very busy place. Was pleased to hear a small jazz duo when I accidentally had to return to the lobby. Something like that should have been mentioned at check in. A real plus.Because Friedmans adjoining the hotel offers room service we decided to go there for ourselves and were very pleased with the lunch ordered,",3,hotbutton,September 2019
76,"Good value, great location, average experience. ","We stayed at the Hotel Edison September 7-9th to celebrate our anniversary. Overall a nice hotel that we would consider staying at again.The NegativesWe arrived early and took our chances at an early check in. We were told that a room was available but early check in would cost $79.00 or we could upgrade to a suite with a good view, etc. for only $120.00 and check in right away. We felt kind of scammed right from the start....we declined the offer. The concierge was not helpful at all. We asked several questions about pretty standard things (eg. best way to buy tickets for the 9/11 memorial museum, best way to get certain places) and she offered little guidance or help. The room was tiny (standard queen room - 1538) and had probably the worst view ever.The PositivesThe room was very clean, bed was comfortable, and the bathroom (recently renovated?) was really nice, good shower.  Complimentary in room water was a nice touch. The location simply can't be beat. You're essentially right in Times Square and have easy access to a lot of cool areas - whether by foot or quick and easy access to the Subway station. We didn't Uber or cab anywhere! The price was very good when compared to other similar hotels in the same area. The wifi worked well.As I said, overall a nice hotel that we would consider staying at again, but nothing mind-blowing.",3,shanm,September 2019
77,Great stay!,"I recently stayed here with my family for a few days for some sporting activities at Chelsea piers and sightseeing and shopping. Had a really great stay. The room was very reasonably priced for the Times Square area, and it was very clean and well appointed, and of good size for NYC. Housekeeping staff did a great job of cleaning up the room and the staff from the bellman to the management were all top notch.  Hotel staff were all very friendly. This hotel also has some pretty good bars and restaurants. Had great service and food for breakfast at Friedman’s - they were very good accommodating my kids allergies. Also enjoyed some great cocktails at the rum house, which is the bar in the front of the hotel. They were not cheap for sure but very reasonably priced compared to area bars.  We also enjoyed the “Edison hour” which involved complementary wine, snacks and music in the lobby. Will definitely stay here again next time we comeTo NYC and would probably also stay here for business if I needed to be in midtown area.",5,Chris W,September 2019
78,Fantastic hotel in perfect location!,"Hotel Edison has the boutique feel but all the modern day benefits.  The rooms are clean and updated with marble bathroom vanities and a modern shower.  The beds are plush and comfortable and have a sleek look and feel.  The Guest Ambassador made my daughters feel like VIPs and were so sweet.  We loved the location as it was perfectly close to fabulous restaurants, all the Broadway theaters, Times Square, easy walk to Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue shops, Central Park and Empire State Building.  Easy walking access also to Grand Central Station.  We loved the vintage environment with the big city amenities and access!  We also loved the breakfast in the cafe downstairs and the Rum House bar was lively and fun.  Highly recommend this hotel if you are looking for the true NYC experience in a fantastic hotel in the perfect location!",5,Rebecca W,September 2019
79,AWESOME Hotel!!!!,"Me and my best friend, stayed here for 5 nights, from August 24-29. We arrived to check in at 7:15pm, and were told that our room wasn’t ready and we’d have to wait about 30mins. The lady checking us in, must have saw how tired we were (we had been up and traveling since 2:45am), that she called us back with our room key, just 10mins later. She also gave us 2 vouchers each, for breakfast at Friedman’s restaurant in the hotel, where we could order whatever and however much we wanted! So that was greatly appreciated! We have nothing but good things to say about the hotel, our hotel room, and it’s staff! This was my first time in NYC and I was warned that the hotel rooms in NYC would be very small and that the waits on elevators would be long. But we were quite surprised with how big our room was!! We had two queen beds, and there was PLENTY of space for the both of us and all our things. It was very clean, and all looked newly renovated. The bathroom was a little bit tiny, but nothing we couldn’t deal with or complain about. Water pressure was great!!! We were on the 9th floor in room 917, facing the front of the hotel.. We had 3 bottles of water and Starbucks coffee, replaced in our room everyday too. We never once had to wait anymore then, 30-45 seconds for an elevator. The absolute best part of the hotel, was it’s location! It was less then a minutes walk, from the front door, to Times Square. The hop on hop off bus had a hop on location on either end of the street. 15-20mins walk to Empire State/Macy’s area, 10min walk to Rockefeller Center area. 10-15min walk to Central Park (Plaza Hotel entrance). 3-5min walk to most Broadway Show theatres.",5,tarajenkins88,August 2019
80,Wonderful hotel near Times Square!,Hotel Edison is a wonderful place to stay while you are in NYC!  You will be close to everything...especially Times Square!  The staff was amazing!  Security is top notch.  The restaurants were delicious.  I have no complaints about this amazing hotel!!  I will definitely stay there on my next trip to NYC!,5,TriciaP,August 2019
81,Great!,"We had a wonderful experience at this hotel.  Wish it could have been longer this time.  This was only our second stay at the Edison, but it will be our go to destination from now on when we visit this wonderful city.",5,UpstateNewYorkers,September 2019
82,Hotel Edison. Fabulous stay!,My husband and I had a great time at the Hotel Edison. Great location to all the sights. The staff was extremely attentive. Our concierge was super helpful getting us great theater tickets at the last minute. We definitely recommend this hotel and can’t wait to come back.,5,Lorraine M,September 2019
83,Rude staff and unwelcoming hotel,"I stayed in this hotel  with my family for 3 nights in 2 different rooms for different dates. When I asked to be kept to same room, I was told that this was not possible; nor were the problems with my room was responded or rectified.Also the behavior of the lady at the reception was shameful. When I asked - she told breakfast is not included in the price for my rooms. I provided her booking proof. Then she changed her statement saying she handed me breakfast coupons and she has the camera recordings when i checked in. I asked her to show me camera recordings which she could not provide me either even after wasting my 30 mins of time. She was rude, arrogant and unwelcoming. I hope other travelers do not face this on their trip to NYC.Restaurant  people were also very rude and has limited options for hotel rooms with breakfast included. Overall very bad experiences with the hotel.",1,onmytrip_Atul,August 2019
84,Excellent Location!,"This hotel is located in the Times Square & Theater District area.  Very easy to get around to see many sights.  There are eateries in the hotel & a huge amount of restaurants nearby.  The rooms are modernized & the hotel is very secure, with you having to show your room key before getting into the elevator!  A good place to stay.",4,Phyllis H,August 2019
85,Tired Hotel,"We spent 3 nights in New York at the Edison. The hotel in general need serious upgrades. Our room was old and dingy and noisy, but clean. The bed was hard and the sides of the mattress where broken down which gave me the uneasy feeling of rolling off during my sleep. The bathroom was very very small!  I dealt with front desk on three occasions. One time out of the three I actually had a friendly and helpful person. The other two ... not so much. It’s location is very good being close to theatres and Time Square. We will never stay here again",3,grovester,September 2019
86,Convenient Location,"We had booked twin share and were given a pokey room with one double bed. Had to get our traveling companions paperwork to prove it was the same as theirs and they had two queen beds. Took some time but they changed our room.The room was tired and worn with cracks in the plaster, mould in the bathroom and stains and iron scorch marks on the carpet. My white socks were black after one day. The furniture was old and the paint blistered. There was no bar fridge and no tea or coffee making facilities.We paid more for our room than our other family members.  Watch out for the daily “service charges” which are $28 per day. They will charge you whether you use them or not. Services are having your bed made, towels changed, bottled water and WiFi. Be careful...they cut your WiFi off after three nights!!!The location was handy and pretty much right on Times Square. It was really noisy all night and outside, it was quite smelly.I would not go back there.",2,Judie T,September 2019
87,I’m a fan!,"Over the past three years I have stayed at least once a year (often more) whenever I am in town to catch up on broadway shows. Clean rooms, efficient checkins, close to everything, and a really nice touch with a happy hour for guests on Tuesdays and Fridays. This past trip I got in very early in the morning and I thank Justina for giving me a complimentary early checkin so I could get some rest from a long journey. This place strives to make you happy.",5,VinceMKE,September 2019
88,Nice location.....,"Location is very good. The room we got was dirty and VERY worn. Tapestry falling of. Only one bedside stand, so no reading light on one side of the bed. Breakfast was excellent with good service. 4 choices on our vouchers.",1,KES68,September 2019
89,Great Location,"Excellent location right in Times Square!Hotel is clean and comfortable  if your not happy with the room ,they are more than happy to shift you to a better one. .The staff are friendly and the hotel restaurant /bar is great value for your money but you are right in the heart of the square so it's not far to find what you are looking for close at hand",4,dee001930,August 2019
90,What a location!,I chose this hotel due to its location and it was spot on! Literally a minutes walk into the heart of Times Square. It’s also about a two minute walk from the Hop On - Hop Off sightseeing bus stop which is fantastic.The Lion King on Broadway (what a show!) was one street away and the little deli at the end of the street (called Carve) had incredible pizza and sandwiches so you really couldn’t ask for more in terms of location.The staff I met were all lovely and helpful. I can see how other reviewers may have felt reception were a bit off but they were just super efficient dealing with large numbers of people checking in and out constantly.The room itself was a total let down. We were on the 7th floor and it’s badly in need of an upgrade. However saying that it was cleaned very well everyday and the complementary bottles of water were very useful each day. We stayed 4 nights and spent around 5 - 6 hours a night sleeping as we were determined to see as much as possible. Therefore whilst an incredibly old room it was adequate for us. I have to say even staying on the 7th floor the noise from outside wasn’t bad at all and the added security of having to show your room key to access the lifts / elevators was reassuring. If I am lucky enough to come back to New York I’d stay here again without a doubt!,4,Nicwham,September 2019
91,Left a little disappointed ,Our 3rd visit to NYC and first time at Hotel Edison. First impression was the hotel was quite small and the reception staff whilst efficient didn’t seem very friendly. Our classic room bore no resemblance to the brochure photos. It was very small no view and a very tired bathroom with tiles hanging off. We had lots planned so literally just used our room to sleep in so we didn’t complain at the time. On the plus side the location is great you literally step out into broadway and Times Square. There was complimentary bottles of water daily which was appreciated. There were only 2 pillows and we asked twice at reception for extra pillows. It took to day 3 to get them!! Overall we had a great 4 days in NY and the Edison is great for local attractions however I came home I was covered on insects bites which I got on the last night of course I can’t say with any certainty that I got them at the hotel but all in all I wouldn’t chose to stay at the Edison for future trips. I am normally quite easily pleased but felt the hotel needed renovation and our room was in need of updating had a slightly dirty feel especially the bathroom. We looked at reviews before we booked and the hotel looked great and that’s why we booked so maybe we’ve just been unlucky.,3,Freeman172,August 2019
92,Best place to stay in Times Square!,"I've stayed at the Edison several times while in NYC.  It is my go to hotel to be where all the action is!  Half block from TKTS, convenient walk to theater district.  Staff has always been pleasant and I love the wine and snacks in the lobby!",5,Dianne S,September 2019
93,Hotel Edison,"Very good hotel in terms of Value for money, cleanliness, proximity to different shops and transportation like train, taxis and buses, amazing customer service and best part is 2 Minutes walk to Time Square.",5,Jong,September 2019
94,Good service,"Hemlatha singh is the best! Her service was full of kindness and help. She cleaned very good and she makes us feel comfortable in our vacation . Thank you hemlatha .The hotel is clean and beautiful, the location is the best! It’s on the Times Square!!",5,Amit M,September 2019
95,Expedia Booking,"The pictures on expedia certainly gave a much grander perception of the hotel .  Was very small, lacked conveniences, view, and the bathroom was old and musty smelling.  Was a fantastic location to Times Square.  When in NYC you are only in the hotel to sleep...  good thing!",3,LuvVactns,September 2019
96,Great location but...,"The hotel is located close to Times Square- easy to walk to. Concierge  got us to the subway which is easy to maneuver and highly recommended for saving money while site seeing. The room was incredibly small and the temperature was hard to control- we went back and forth from low heat to medium cooling and couldn’t find a happy medium. The price we were quoted was a joke- ended up paying much, much more once all the fees and taxes were added in. Parking is extremely expensive and they didn’t tell us until we had our car brought out that there aren’t in and out “privileges”- park at the Icon garage down the street and reserve ahead to save some money. Our shower door didn’t close- slid open after closing it so the bathroom floor got very wet- used our towels to sop up water. We had a lot to cover on our trip and no time to deal with that- wish the room had been up to par before they let us check in.",3,4everPSU,September 2019
97,Hotel,Okay not bad because you can walk too  time square  new York  new York..and  have  good  views and  the food opens  all day and all night...only bad things about this location is the weather rain and snow and super cold  doing the winter time,3,Sam P,September 2019
98,Favorite hotel in the heart of the theatre district,"We have stayed at the Edison many times. This stay was one of our best. The Terrace room was lovely. Breakfast at Friedman's was great. Rum Room is iconic. Jaclyn, in guest services, was very helpful in assuring us a king size bed and that our room would be held for late check-in. A flight delay and long transfer from La Guardia made our arrival very late. Recommend spending extra for a Signature Room and requesting a room on a higher floor. We will be back soon",5,VLynch,August 2019
99,Time Square,Great service from Check to Check out to Door and Room.  Location is so convenient to  get to all the Broadway Shows and attractions. Plenty on chain and local places to eat to try all the food option.  Beds a bit on the hard side but would stay at this property again.,4,KimG82019,August 2019
100,"Reasonable rates, nice room","We had a nice room with a King bed - very nice with a nice bathroom.  We had wifi included with our room deal, but it was extremely limited due to lack of security.  Other than that - great experience.  The bar & restaurants were a bit pricey, there are great places nearby.  We were less than 2 blocks from many theaters and dining options plus Times Square.  I would recommend this hotel - look for a deal online through one of the travel services.",4,Gary C,August 2019
101,Hospitality,"This is my second time staying at Hotel Edison Times Square.  I would like to highlight Daniel O'Brien, Area Director of Security, for being so kind to me and Bill.  It was our last day in New York and we asked about keeping our bags at the hotel, after we checked out, so we could continue to sightseeing.  He informed us they do watch bags after check out and gave us complimentary breakfast tickets for Friedmans.  The entire staff in the restaurant were so friendly to us.  The staff in the hotel was very friendly and helpful.",5,yogamo,July 2019
102,"Location is great - bathroom nice marble shower, but out beds were hard as rocks","We were on a tour of New York City and this is where we stayed.  As stated above, the beds were so very hard.  we probably should have asked for a different room.  We were on the 19th floor, so it wasn't too noisy, and the windows had light blocking shades  The elevators were prompt.We wereoSOOOO",3,Jeanie B,August 2019
103,Difficult Stay,"Stayed here for 4 nights on a trip to NY and on to Vegas, based on my experience I can't recommend that you stay at this property. We visited in the middle of a heatwave and peak tourist season.The hotel is dated but undergoing significant renovation, the communal areas are quirky and in keeping with a hotel of the Edison's age. Security is adequate and not intrusive.Unfortunately, our first impression was not great - the room we were initially assigned had clearly not been renovated and was very far from the advertised spec. In addition, the air conditioning unit had leaked a significant amount of smelly water all over the carpet and the ventilation unit from the adjacent building was so incredibly loud that sleeping in this room was almost impossible. The carpet was threadbare, furniture looked like something out of a yard sale, and the bathroom was... very tired, but spotlessly clean.After we raised a complaint with the front desk, we were moved to a modernised room on a higher floor. The room itself was fantastic, with a really comfortable bed, well appointed, luxurious bathroom and modern amenities like USB chargers and flat screen television. Unfortunately, at some point prior to our stay there must have been a leak in the pipe in the ceiling, and the now dry plaster crumbled onto my bed over the stay - this was taken care of by the housekeeping staff but was still frustrating and uncomfortable. The room came with a Keurig machine and was kept fully stocked. The only thing that detracted from the whole experience was the trash can adorned with ""TRASH ONLY"" in a huge font. Bit weird.The big problem, that went unresolved for the duration of our stay, was the noise. I appreciate that NY is the city that never sleeps, and being located just off Times Square meant that it was never going to be peaceful. That said, our window simply did not close - there was significant and dangerous play between the bottom and top panes which was fixed to the frame with an L bracket when we complained, providing some security but no actual seal.Through the course of raising and remedying these issues, we got to know the front desk and management staff, who were all really helpful and a huge asset to the hotel. To their credit, everything with the exception of the window and the crumbling plaster was resolved really quickly, and I appreciate that the latter issues were in need of a long term solution.We were fortunate enough to dine at Friedman's for breakfast and stopped back a few times over our stay for drinks. It's expensive but decorated tastefully and the food is fantastic. A real redeeming feature for the property.Its difficult to say whether this hotel presents value for money, if you're paying a budget rate for a budget room, then there are more comfortable and better appointed properties out there. If you're staying here, then I would strongly recommend upgrading your room and you'll have an enjoyable stay.",2,Jack N,August 2019
104,Stylish and great atmosphere ,Stayed at the hotel for one night. And that was a really nice experience. All the staff is very professional and very friendly. The bar / restaurant on the ninth floor has a really nice ambience. Rooms are small but well designed.Nice gym with big windows towards Times Square.,5,Jaco_DENM,September 2019
105,Hotel Edison is perfect,Hotel Edison is a wonderful hotel right off  Times Square. It is a reasonably priced full service hotel conveniently located with  good sized modern clean rooms and helpful staff.  We have been staying at the Addison whenever we go to New York City for the past 30 years.  I wouldn’t stay anywhere else.,5,Lendra K,August 2019
106,"Excellent location, communication appalling",The hotel is in a fantastic location couldnt fault it when we were there. You do pay a 100 USD deposit. My gripe is to this day i have not recieved my deposit back. After numerous emails and phone calls all communication has ceased now. I feel that the customer service is excellent when your there but when your leave they dont honour there 2 to 4 week refund policy and stop communication. Be careful if yoi dont want 100 usd back stay at this hotel. If you dont want 100 usd refunded then stay. Takes the shine of a lovely stay.,2,supershoey,June 2019
107,Broadway comfort,"My recent stay st the Hotel Edison was certainly a true surprise. Given the location and age of the hotel, I did not expect the comfort and convenience which it afforded. As I am quite a Broadway buff, I felt at home in the location and was able to walk to all theaters where I attended performances. Combined with the cleanliness of the room, my stay was a joy.  Will consider making a stay at the hotel each month to get my Broadway fill.",5,Happiness10667,August 2019
108,Average hotel,This hotel is a bit dated.  Our room had toilet with kick flush like a school lavatory.  The rooms were bit small but it was very clean and the staff is very attentive and pleasant.  We went with a bus tour so I am sure they try to keep cost down so if you don't mind the thrills its just fine.  Bed was comfy and if you want a coffee maker you have to ask for it at check in.  Rooms have no frig or microwave either.,3,Janet E,August 2019
109,Staying in The Big Apple - Perfect Location,"We've stayed twice at the Hotel Edison and I highly recommend it for many reasons. The location is convenient to walk to major sights or catch the subway. You are definitely in the heart of the city and it's great. Even if you are nightowls and want to wander into the wee hours, you are in a place where you feel safe. We arrived late on a weeknight 2 weeks before Christmas for a 5 day stay. What could have been a nightmare the hotel staff was quick to prevent. Our reservation was made months prior on a card that was cancelled due to being lost. While the bank reissued us a card, the number was different than what the original reservation was made on. Because we were late arrivals and hadn't requested that, our reservation was cancelled that evening. So, we arrive and have no rooms for a party of 4. Hotel Mgt Scott and Danny were terrific in helping us out. At 11:30 pm instead of just saying this is the holiday season sorry we are booked, they did their best to help us. We were put in single rooms for 1 night, at this point we would have taken a closet, and then moved to double rooms the next day when they became available. 2 stays at the busiest time of year in NY City, I wouldn't stay anywhere else. Attentive staff, clean rooms, great location and management was very accessible and helpful.",5,Janet Sue,December 2018
110,Convenient lication,"Nice enough hotel, but the decor is old and tired and the rooms are very small. It is clean, and the bathroom is good (but really small too). Location is perfect - seconds from Times Square. If you just need a bed and shower, it’s fine. The WiFi doesn’t work properly, and the TV guide doesn’t come up either! You can leave bags with concierge after check out too for $1 per bag.  Breakfast buffet ends at 11am, and lunch doesn’t start until 11:30.",4,Jojoscorpio72,August 2019
111,Perfect Location for Everything!,"This was the third time I took my 2 daughters to New York and I included my grand daughter this time. We choose a different area of New York to stay each time and decided on Hotel Edison Times Square this time and I'm glad we did. The location is in the heart of Times Square, close to subways, shopping galore, good restaurants, Central Park and of course all that Broadway has to offer!We arrived at 6:00am and our room was ready by 9:30am which was very much appreciated after flying all night. The front desk and staff were all friendly and helpful.  We will definately stay here again!",5,Dave B,August 2019
112,Great 1st NY experience.,Great hotel. Attentive staff. Perfectly positioned. Mmm... 145 letters to go... Nothing else to add.As for midtown Manhattan. Central Park 10 minutes walk away. Times Square 2 minutes away plus the subway to anywhere. Go visit.,5,Sarah J,August 2019
113,Another great stay,"The third time we have visited the Edison and once again, we left totally satisfied. From the prompt and easy check-in experience to the Manhattan's at the Rum House, we thoroughly enjoy this conveniently located hotel. Try Bond 45 (on site) restaurant one of the best breakfast buffets in town!",5,Daryl J,July 2019
114,Amazing Stay,"Hotel is in the heart of everything to include shopping, theatre, site-seeing, restaurants. Experienced very good customer service + was upgraded to a great/very comfortable room with city view. Will definitely be back!!",4,Heather R,September 2018
115,Great location,"Customer service awesome, clean rooms, fast easy check in and check out. Only down fall was I couldn't access the internet even when they mention I have to sign in using email address i checked in with. Will be back.",4,Summertime,August 2019
116,Awesome stay at Hotel Edison in NYC,"Had such a nice smooth experience with Hotel Edison from making the reservation to checking out. Scott Geres took our reservation and made sure we had everything we needed and answered all of our questions. The valet parking attendant made parking easy, check in was a breeze while checking out and retrieving my car was also smooth. Good security and every Hotel worker is eager to provide help. Best location. Would definitely stay here again",5,Matt,August 2019
117,Tasteful and relaxing,"My partner, my mother and I recently stayed in Hotel Edison for a long weekend. The double queen and single king rooms we stayed in were comfortable and designed in muted, calming, dark hues, perfect to soothe the nerves from the jangling neon and LED lights of Times Square just around the corner. It would have been nice to have a minifridge to stash our restaurant leftovers in, but that was really the only minor inconvenience. The service was pleasant, welcoming and professional. Even though there was a mix-up with our booking when we arrived, Tony, Val, Letty and Scott all took excellent care of us while also deftly keeping the packed lobby and long line of guests moving at a good clip. There are signs indicating that the building is currently under renovation but I didn't find it obtrusive or notice any disruption at all. Lovely 1920s-30s art deco interior design, and right by Hell's Kitchen and tons of great restaurants.",5,Sam H.,August 2019
118,New Years Eve stay,"Do not stay here for New Years Eve unless you plan on staying inside the hotel for the whole day on New Years Eve.Unfortunately I had not read this in any reviews I had previously read prior to booking.My husband and I wanted to make good use of every day that we were in New York as there is obviously so much to do and it was our first time visiting this famous city!  On New Years eve we were exploring the city and by chance wanted to return to the hotel (earlier than we were going to originally) and upon on return many of the streets leading to the hotel were closed.  Many officers directed us to other streets which were the same and the cycle started again.Eventually we made our way to a street by the hotel but this was closed off despite us being a few feet from our hotel entrance.  We obviously explained to the officer that we were staying at the hotel but we (along with many other people) were not allowed though and were told only residents could pass.We were waiting outside our hotel at this blockade for at least three hours in the rain feeling like cattle.  I at many points was pressed painfully against the metal fence with the increasing amount of people trying to get through.  Finally a hotel owner could see my distress and told the officer that I was resident and I was allowed through with my husband.  Surely this is not the first New Year Eve for this to happen? And surely the hotel should inform their guests of this prior to booking?  All we were given were wrist bands and assurances that the officers would let us through if we showed them.  That was not the case.Also, there are many pubs, clubs, restaurants, etc. offering New Years Eve parties.  Be careful with this.  We booked one of these parties at 'The Mean Fiddler' (an irish pub).  If we had not been in the hotel opposite this pub we would not have been able to get in even if we had paid, due to the streets being blocked.  I think this is a scam by many places in the times square area as they must know people are paying but won't be able to access the streets to get there.I won't leave a detailed comment on this review about the party but it was ok.I would also like to note that when we first arrived we were given a room which reminded me of something out of American Horror story and after explaining my disappointment to management she gave us a complimentary upgrade straight away.I expect if you are staying here any other time of the year it is nice enough but I would not recommend if you are staying for New Years Eve.",3,Hannah H,December 2018
119,President,"I stayed in a beautiful refurbished room. Beautifully decorated with a great bathroom.... especially the shower. Check in was a breeze.... let me check in early. The Tuesday “Edison Hour” was great. Nice wines and food. Rommel Gopez, the Dir of Hospitality is wonderful. Both restaurants are great. Oh, and the live flower arrangements to this gardener were tops!",5,wbeachguy,August 2019

121,Great Location just off Times Square!,"From the time we exited our taxi until we hopped back in to head for the train, Hotel Edison staff was right there with the White Glove Treatment!  Our suite was nice, clean, and comfortable. Freidman's Cafe was casually upscale and fairly expensive, but the food tasted great!  Just walk through the hotel and out the door and there is ""Hamilton"" at the Richard Rodger's Theater, which is my absolute favorite show of all time! Go out the front door and down about 200 feet, and you're at the Brooks Atkinson Theater.  We saw Waitress there.  We needed handicap assistance and were very satisfied in every aspect.  Great Hotel!",5,Classicroyal1964,August 2019
122,A shabby hotel,We stayed three nights at the Hotel Edison Time Square - it is undergoing a refurb but is presently very shabby - not worth a visit - wait until the refurbishment is finished. The area is also very busy - some of the retro scenes in the foyer/lobby area are good,2,bob l,August 2019
123,Make sure to take your belongings ,My husband and I stayed in Hotel Edison in April this year. Staff seemed nice. Didn’t eat the food there as there was so many other places near the hotel. Hotel is nice but needs a bit of updating. After we left the hotel I realized I had left my wedding ring and engagement ring in the bathroom of our room. Since April I have rang the hotel at least a dozen times and sent 3 emails to be getting a response of give us ur contact details we will contact you back. I was in such a state that I ended up contacting Expedia who we booked the hotel with and eventually got a response. Supposedly no rings !! So 5 months later I eventually got an answer but where have the rings gone ?? Disaster .,1,Karen D,April 2019
124,Adequate,"Well placed if you like busy buzzy Times Square and the Theatre.Very dark and unfriendly reception area, with people queuing and hanging around. The room on the 20th floor was in need of a makeover.  The bathroom door had scribble all over it, and was unfinished and not painted.  Coffee, but no tea facilities, but “free” water until you are told facilities (incl WiFi) are an extra US$56 .  The view was depressing, overlooking other buildings, but so high up we expected it.",3,Alison Tavener,August 2019
125,Interesting hotel,Hotel convenient for Time Square. hotel very clean our maids Roase and Charles were very helpful . Bonus lovely coffe maker and water in our room.Room cleanDid not like the transparent sliding bathroom door which never closed.The WiFi was not secure had  messages when we tried to join.Security very good,4,HJLlan,August 2019
126,AMAZING LOCATION,"The Edison is in the most amazing location. walk outside the entrance and not even a 20 second walk to your right and you’re on times square. About an hours drive from the airport. We walked everywhere, but on occasion used the subway which are located about a 2 min walk away both ways. We bought a weeks  subway pass which was only $37 (we never used taxis so for us this was great) resort fee was $28 per night, this was held on a credit card upon arrival and taken as we checked out after 4 nights.We had an upgraded room, which was gorgeous - 1920’s art deco theme. Air con 24/7 & free wifi. Security check your room key every time you enter so you felt 100% safe.Bedding and towels changed everyday, free bottled water replenished everyday. Lovely modern, clean bathroom and plenty of space in the smaller rooms for a couple (wardrobe space was good size for a short stay)Staff were lovely. The little cafe/restaurant that was attached to the hotel was SO expensive, we only ate there on our last morning and wish we had just been to a local diner like the other mornings (we paid $9 for an orange juice!)I would 100% stay here on my next trip, could not fault a thing relating to this hotel",5,Meghan,June 2019
127,Nice historic hotel,"I stayed two nights in the Edison while attending a conference a few blocks away. It's a good location near Times Square. I booked it because of it's history and design. The room was comfortable, quiet (19th floor). Smallish and rather plain, but the price was great for the area. I booked directly with the hotel and they had a summer deal. It was not as interesting as some historic hotels, but it was a great value. And I loved the idea that Thomas Edison turned on the lights when it opened in 1931.",4,Barbara F,August 2019
128,Amazing Staff,"My stay was amazing, the room was so clean and cozy. The location was perfect, walking distance to Times Square and all attractions. Special thanks to Scott, the general manager, Danny O'Brien, Director of Security and Roger, rooms division manager  and the entire housekeeping staff for making my stay incredible.",5,R.W.,August 2019
129,Just right for our stay.,"Met my adult daughter and partner in NYC for a long weekend.  Hotel Edison was a great location and recommended by my sister, who travels a lot.  Our beds were fantastic, the towels lush, the hot water plenty. Sometimes these historic hotels have and odor, and this was NOT the case here.  Very clean, not too bad with sound issues. There was some confusion at check in due to late flights and two separate reservations, but Scott was quick to remedy the kerfuffle and we were treated like VIPs the entire stay.  Hand written notes in our rooms with fruit and water and chocolate.  Val (day manager) walked us to our rooms and made sure everything was to our approval.  Felt super cared for by security no matter what time of day we left or what time of the wee morning we returned.  Didn't use many amenities as we bopped in the city all day, but wifi was strong and reliable and free.  Definitely will return.",5,Kathy H,August 2019
130,We upgraded our room for very little more and it was perfect.,We had a really nice experience at this hotel.  Justina on the front desk was super patient and helpful to us.  The security staff were all real gentlement and the location was fantastic. Breakfast was excellent and the food service staff were all bubbly aspiring actors and actress's,5,Edmckee,August 2019
131,"Great stay, great location","Our room was huge, clean and updated, comfortable beds. The gym is equipped with everything you need to get a full body workout in as well. The location is superb since it’s right by Times Square and there are so many places to eat, shop and see within walking distance. I recommend working your way west into Hell’s Kitchen for a more authentic dining experience. All of the staff we came across was exceptional and a big thank you to Mr. Lindsay for taking care of us and making us feel special!",5,Nele M,August 2019
132,Birthday Weekend in Manhattan/Times Square,"Once gain, the team at the Hotel Edison went above and beyond.  I had emailed the guest relations team with a mention that we were comng to NYC for my husband's birthday.  Once we arrived to the room, we were greated by a Happy Birthday sign as well as some treats.  Our room was fantastic.  This time we also ate at Bond 45 as well as Sherman's, both of which are located in the Hotel.  I cannot thank Rommel and Jaclyn in guest relations enough.  This was our thrid stay this this hotel this year.  The Hotel Edison never disappoints us.",5,chapmanbobrn,August 2019
133,Fantastic safe location in Times Square. A beautiful hotel!,Very nice and safe hotel 1/4 of a block from Times Square. Door man and security man checking your key card before entering the elevator. Free happy hour on Tuesday & Friday evening. You are in the heart of everything.,5,aopdebeek,August 2019
134,Epic stay at the Edison!,"Wonderful few days with the family at the Edison. Val and Tony at the front desk took amazing care of us, making sure our stay was perfect. The family room is the perfect fit for our family of five. There’s no better place to be when you bring the family to NYC.",5,SBC,August 2019
135,Don’t stay here ,"Got here on Tuesday around 4pm and it wasn’t too busy when I checked in. The lobby looked promising and the location was superb, but as soon as I got in my first room (on the 5th floor) it was as if I went back in time to the 70’s. The room was dark and dingy, disgusting. The bathroom looked as if it had not been updated in at least 50 years. I went downstairs and told them that the room looked nothing like the room pictured when I booked the hotel. He looked at my reservation and said it was because I booked a “classic” room and the updated and refurbished rooms were “signature” rooms. He offered to switch me to a  room of the same caliber that was more updated. Since I was pressed for time I just decided to stay in the 5th floor room one night. It was soooooo noisy that it made it difficult to sleep. Second night I got a room on the 15th floor, looked the same. Lol. But the bathroom looked like it was updated 40 years ago instead. 🙄 whatever, I decided to bite my tongue and just keep the room. Upon checkout I asked the hotel to hold our bags for us so we could get breakfast before our flight. They charge $1 per bag! Wtf?! I’ve never heard of something so absurd. Don’t stay here, it’s a joke.",1,Jennifer D,August 2019
136,Perfect for NYC,"It's the perfect location close to all the action, and easy access to subway to all the rest of the action; great price, every comfort and amenity, including friendly concierge to help you make the most of your activities;and friendly service. With all that, you can freely enjoy everything the city has to offer. They even provided me an umbrella when a crazy afternoon storm popped up!",5,MelandKody,August 2019
137,"In the mittel of ""there everything happends in NY.","The Edison Hotel is fantastc, friendly and nice and a superb location!The room is not big but contains everything you need, e.g. safe, air condition and free mineral water every day! The Rum House, inside the hotel, have good music every evening and serve all kind of drinks,",4,Berlin,August 2019
138,A great time in NYC,"I had a great time in NYC mostly because I was at the best location in the city, with great access to transportation and near Times Square and The Broadway Theatre. The staff made my stay very comfortable and friendly with their high standards service. Thank you for a great time in NYC.",5,Ron H,August 2019
139,A large great place to stay,"We stayed here for only one night. A last minute booking. The deal was too good to pass up. With that, we loved the location thou we aren't into this touristy part of the city. It's a great location for shopping and Broadway shows and will keep it in mind for our next trip if the price is right again. Our room was super small, bathroom even smaller, but we get a kick out of this and consider it ""typical NYC"" and it's never a complaint. Our room was behind the elevator shafts and surprisingly very quiet. Staff was very accommodating and helpful and plenty are around for help and answering questions. Enjoyed and loved the art work on the walls. For a spur of the moment booking, we loved it. Didn't try out the restaurant there. We feel there are so many affordable places to eat in the city and don't take advantage of the hotel's food.",5,Cindy M,August 2019
140,Edison Hotel,"Recently, I stayed at The Edison Hotel, in Time Square, which is my 3rd time staying there.  The experience has always been great.  It is a great hotel, as it is centrally located in Time Square and ideal to everything in NYC.  I must also commend the staff and the Assistant GM Roger, for once again making me and my 10 year old daughter feel like we are home.  The Edison is true jewel of New York City...",5,Dennis,August 2019
141,Pretty good hotel within 50 feet of Times Square,"A hotel with small, but clean rooms. Very small bathroom when you are with two or more. Friendly staff. You are really in seconds on Times Square and considering this is the price for a room pretty low. A big minor is the fact that we were obligated to pay $25 + taxes for WiFi without notice. To pay for WiFi is not strange, but you must have a choice. Besides there was a very weak WiFi signal, so only in the bathroom there was a good signal (!)But all in all it is een nice hotel for the place in New York with a reasonable price. If you only want to visit the highlights and only sleep in the hotel, highly recommended",4,Ruud,August 2019
142,Great location in  theatre district!!,"We had a great stay at the Edison!   For the price it's a bargain. The location is outstanding -- right in the theatre district with fantastic dining and bars close by.   It is literally right around the corner from Times Square!   So much fun to walk around there and only 1 minute back to the hotel!  The staff is very friendly and nice -- not so much in the Rum bar, but the drinks were good.   The room is a good size, bathroom a little small, but all was clean and towels were nice.   There was complimentary bottled water in the room.  Lots of elevators that come quickly!   The staff really helped us out by getting a shuttle for us to LGA.   They arranged it just for us based on our flight time.  I'll definitely stay here again!",5,Jackie W,August 2019
143,Hotel Edison Times Square NYC,"Great value for money room wise and staff are very helpful and pleasant.We had to ask for a coffee maker for our room and the air conditioning is noisy - bathroom in need of renovation but overall perfectly comfortable and clean.We didn’t eat in the hotel restaurant as very pricey but this is a good place to stay for room value and central locationI would recommend it but buy your breakfast outside on 8th Avenue from the cafe opposite the Hilton Hotel which is a really reasonable deli. You can sit here and have coffee, orange juice, fruit, croissant and freshly made filled bagels to order and the prices are fair which is unusual for Times Square. Other places we noticed changed their prices every day and most places demand an 18% service charge whether or not you feel like tipping.Edison Hotel makes a great base from which to explore Manhattan and beyond....",4,Victoria S,August 2019
144,Great location,"We stayed five nights in the Edison. It was my second time, being the first in the nineties of last century. The rooms were naturally updated since then but there’s still some old-fashioned ambience that reigns in the hotel. In a few words, the hotel has as its most valuable asset the location, within one minute (or less) from Times Square. Regarding the rest, the rooms are small, but functional, and you don’t go to NY to spend much time in the room; in any case, some improvements and updates are required, namely in the bathroom. The wifi in our room was extremely slow and it worked intermittently. The staff, namely the cleaning ladies, was very nice and polite. In sum, good quality/price relation and excellent location but still with a considerable path ahead to have more than the location to be recommended.",3,LeonorGSCF,August 2019
145,"A great place to stay, great location, and a great staff!","The hotel is in the heart of times square, close to everything.  The leadership and security at the hotel are second to no one.  Rooms are clean, staff friendly, great security, excellent restaurants, and the bellmen inside and out provide service at the highest level.",5,FarAway41369,August 2019
146,Top notch great value,We had a great stay for a very good price. You will feel like you should have spent more considering the location. I couldn't get my met tickets printed and we ran the air too high and it froze up and both problems were addressed and corrected promptly. Awesome Restaurant and bar. Great hotel to come back to after a busy day in the city. Room was lovely with old school feel. Felt like I was in a movie!,5,deegeesmom,August 2019
147,Recommend!,"The hotel is perfectly located for seeing Broadway shows. It has a lovely Art Deco atmosphere. Friedman’s café inside is excellent—breakfast all day. Security is very good (Tatiyana was particularly helpful). Our only problem was the shuttle in from La Guardia. System is cumbersome and we ended up losing our pre pay because we had to contract another service. It’s easier just to go straight to ground transportation desk at La Guardia and get something right there. Otherwise, we loved our experience and will stay here again.",4,ksfine,August 2019
148,Perfect In Every Way!,"Everything about Hotel Edison is exceptional!  Location-Hospitality-Service-Decor-Food. Arrived on a Friday in time for the complimentary Happy Hr 5-6 which was a great kick-off to our exciting visit to NYC. We were warmly greeted by Rommel and Robbie who mingled with guests and made us all feel special and important. Don't miss seeing a Broadway show and know that most theaters are just a few steps away. The two restaurants, Friedman Cafe and Bond 45, are both wonderful from casual to elegant to night caps in the bar. Our room was lovely with comfortable beds, robes, TV, water, and coffee. Room service was quick and efficient when we needed something. We came and went at all different hours and always felt the staff was attentive and watching out for us. Tex helped us upon check-out and off we went with pastrami sandwiches to go (from Friedman's) in our taxi to LaQuardia. We loved the enthusiasm and energy of everybody at Hotel Edison and being right in the heart of Times Square!  Thank you to Rommel, Robbie, Tex, and all the others who made our stay...Perfect in Every Way!!",5,Destination225559,August 2019
149,1984-2019,This is my second visit to the Edison Hotel. I first attended when in school with friends in the 80's.  NYC was very different then. Since then I have returned to NYC several times and during our last visit we stayed at the Edison. It's an older hotel with renovated rooms in the upper floors.  It was clean the staff was friendly and its location is great. I certainly would stay here again in my next visit.  We had a single queen room. The room was small but clean and it had everything you would ever need.  I would recommend a room with 2 doubles or 2 queen beds. These rooms are much larger then the single queen room. Over all very nice and it was perfect for this trip.,4,Pylon12,August 2019
150,NYC bucket list,"This Hotel is located in the heart of New York if you want to be near to Time Square then you can't be much closer. It is also in the heart of all the shows.The rooms were clean and tidy and when I say rooms I mean I had to be moved after the first night as I always said if I ended up near a noisy extractor fan again I would not be happy. Its bad enough the air conditioning being noisy. Also the first room in the bathroom, the cabinet behind the mirror was rusty. A little off putting and nothing a little metal paint could have fixed or just leave the mirror and add a glass shelf. The second room was clean tidy but smaller than the first,But the biggest problem was the smell coming from the bathroom. I could not be bothered complaining again so we just closed the door and kept the smell in as let's face it you only sleep and wash in your room. Make sure when you go to the hotel you sort out the city tax. When we got there they took a deposit of 100 dollars which in the past I have got back on checkout and then paid cash for the city tax, not here. They take the deposit out of your account and then day by day they take the city tax.When I asked about it they said oh yes that's what they do. Not good if you had a buffer in your account to use when you got back home as you don't get this back until five working days later. Which they told me once I had paid cash for the city tax and cancelled them taking more money off my card. So beware. Appart from that the only food we ate there was the breakfast which was good the rest of the time we tried to find different places to eat. Applebee's is great for breakfast especially if you have children with you as its cheaper than most places. And for evening we recommend Dallas BBQ on West 42nd Street, especially if you like chicken it's good food quick service and reasonable price. We recommend if your there for more than five days to buy a flexi pass 3 or 5 attractions as you also get a hop on hop off bus tour which is great. Easy to get to all the main attractions. We had the five attractions so this gave us 72hrs of using the bus it starts from when you first use the bus. Save going to the attractions closer to you for later when your bus pass runs out. Use it for your attractions further afield. It covers a tour round Brookland too and the hop on hop off Ferries. Ask the sales people they are helpful if you already have one of their passes.           After all that Enjoy NYC it's great.",3,KFB in NYC,August 2019
151,Requires a good upgrade,"OK the location is good (if you want to be close to Times Square), however I would have preferred something at a bit more distant and with better quality. Rooms are small and require a good upgrade in all its aspects. Rooms are also very noisy from other rooms, the corridor, the AC system, the street and you can even hear the rumble from Times Square. The in-house restaurants are very expensive for what they offer and due to the location there are actually not that much sensible priced alternatives (we found a number towards Hell’s Kitchen for breakfast and diner). I will definitely select something else for a future visit. As many other hotels nowadays you need to pay a daily fee for which you get two small bottles of water and access to a very poor wifi. You would hope you get at least a decent wifi nowadays.",3,Bart v,August 2019
152,The great staff @ The Edison,"I cannot say enough about the staff, security and housekeeping crew at The Edison. I've been a guest for years, and this last visit was super impressive! Retrieved a misplaced toiletry bag, served a great meal at Bond 45, fab breakfast at Friedmans!!!  Thanks again!",5,KERRY CRAVEN,August 2019
153,One ply Toliet Paper!,"You are paying for the location...so don't expect much else. Room was smaller than I expected. Smallest room I have had in Manhattan! Hallway was incredibly hot...but ac in room was ok. Water pressure was so so. No vending machines for soda or snacks, have to go to lobby gift shop. The absolute worst was their so called toliet paper...it was the thinnest one ply paper I have ever used. Came apart mid job. Had to go down the block to Duane Reade to get some Charmin. It was THAT bad. So, if you stay here, bring your own like when you go overseas.",3,Abc_20201,August 2019
154,Great location but some of rooms definately need a refurbishment,"Fantastic location.  6 of us stayed in 2 rooms.  My sons room had recently been refurbished and it looked ok,  however, the room we had was in a poor shape.  The enamel on the bath was in a poor way and in one area the wallpaper was coming off the walls.  It did have very comfy beds.The public areas within  this hotel are all very smart. The 4 adults had a very good night in the Rum House which is the bar within the hotel.  Great service and they had a very good jazz band playing on the Wednesday evening.",3,SEAB24,August 2019
155,Nightmare turned into a dream,"Arrived from a long flight from Dublin ... followed by an even longer taxi ride from Newark!! Let’s not talk about it. Arrived at the hotel which was located just a moments walk from Times Square . The first night we were on the 6th floor and the room was awful.. I mean a scene from a movie back in the 70’s. That night we spoke to an absolutely lovely girl at the reception desk who arranged to move us the very next day. We moved from the 6th floor to the 18th. It was like we jump back into the DeLorean time machine and we were back in 2019. The room had a great view , it was a suite and was super modern. The staff were super friendly and helpful. I would like to thank them all for doing a great job. Other hotels should take note. Down to brass tax: when you book this hotel , insist you stay on one of the floor that has being recently updated.",4,Darren,June 2019
156,Top notch location and hospitality,"I work in the Entertainment Industry in NYC and have a constant influx of people visiting for both professional and personal reasons. I ALWAYS send them to the Hotel Edison. The location is absolutely perfect both for work and play and the Art Deco design is CLASSIC NYC! But above all else, the level of hospitality is always top-notch. A big hats off to  Rommel Gopez who always handles our guests with impeccable attention to detail. Whether A-list celebrity or childhood best friend, you can count on them receiving best in class treatment. We will keep sending our guests to the Edison!",5,myfabny,August 2019
157,Very nice!,"My daughter and granddaughter and I got a junior suite which worked out very well for the 3 of us.   And the location was great.   It is right there with the theaters and Times Square.    Within walking distance of good restaurants, as well as it offers access to two on site restaurants.   The staff was friendly and helpful to us.   It was quiet where we were - no problems with noise within the hotel.    All was clean.   Would like a larger bathroom, but it is an older hotel.    All in all, it was a good experience.",1,Fearless182837,August 2019
158,Highly Disappointed!,"My family and I visited the Edison Hotel recently for a few days. We booked a Junior Suit Room and a Queen Bedroom Room.The Junior Suit room had a distinct smell of mold and sewage, making it almost impossible to sleep. The room was anything but clean. Piles of dust were found in the drawers while Cocacola Cans were visible under the bed as soon as you sat on the couch.The Queen Bedroom was still dirty but not as much, however there was another major problem. The (ancient) air conditioning was so loud that one was unable to sleep. The noise and the dust coming out of it were close to impossible to withstand.Nevertheless, it is worth to mention that Time's Square was just around the corner. If one can withstand all the above, the hotel has the perfect location to visit the New York City.",1,Notis Tzionis,August 2019
159,NYC Favorite,"We have been coming to the Hotel Edison for many years as it is our favorite hotel because of its proximity to Broadway and the many Broadway shows.  This last time was the best.  The concierge was very helpful and the front desk staff were, experienced, kind and helpful.  The rooms were very clean and the housekeeping staff were friendly. This Art Deco building is beautiful, and Friedmans was a great spot to eat in the hotel. There were a group of us scattered around different hotels and when our friends came for a visit they were disappointed they did not choose Hotel Edison.",5,G. Gordon,August 2019
160,Rude Wake Up,"We always try to stay here when we visit the city, location is fantastic and the service is great.  During this trip my children and I were woken up to a loud voice outside our door.I checked to see what was going on assuming it was other hotel guests but it was employees of the hotel.  A gentleman ""reprimanding"" two employee so inappropriately loud that it woke us up.  Maybe not the best place to have that type of interaction??  You would think the consideration of guests would take precedence over an employee issue.",4,disneybride2108,August 2019
161,Good location!,"Perfect location, just in front of time square, reception staff a little unfriendly, my room was a bit small with no view but for a very good price in Manhattan, don't know if I had some kind of offer but it was very cheap considering location.",4,Renzo B.,October 2018
162,Wonderful hotel for first-time visitors to NYC!,"From the moment you step into the Hotel Edison you can feel the rich cultural and architectural history of NYC. My wife and I were visiting NYC for the first time and immediately felt at home after entering our room. We are from the south and had never really been to a major city like this prior to this trip. Some reviews seem to complain about the rooms being too small, however, we did not feel this was the case. Our 1-bed room was far more spatious than we expected! Finally, this hotel is located right on the edge of Times Square, and it was only a 5 minute walk into the ""Hells Kitchen"" neighborhood which offered the best food and drink prices (and friendliest staff!!) we found in Manhattan. Don't let the name of that neighborhood turn you away!We cannot wait to stay at the Edison again the next time we go to NYC.",5,JaredMAdams,August 2019
163,Holiday,"On arrival this hotel looked fantastic from the lobby , even the corridors down to the room looked great . However, when we entered our room , it was dark and not very clean . There was only one bedside locker and the air conditioning unit was right beside the bed . The bathroom was dark and dingy and looked very unclean .After a very long flight we decided to stay in the room , however, the next morning we asked to be moved . We upgraded to a suite for an extra charge . The location of this hotel is excellent but the classic bedrooms are nothing like the pictures and do not resemble a 3 star hotel .",2,SarahC1982,August 2019
164,Not what I expected,"So we arrived  2.10 after flying from Toronto to be told our room was not ready till 3 ok that’s fine so do you have somewhere to leave are luggage. Yes side of hotel lobby and we was CHARGED what can I say €12 pathetic.Came back to get our rooms mine was on the 15th floor dresser was lifted up with two pieces of wood, wallpapers was peeling off the walls, carpet was threadbare ect. I was given another room on the 6th not much better but how much can you complain with kids. I did not want it to put a damper on our trip.. No tea or coffee in the room. No fridge nothing. Yes I know it NYC but it is twenty first century 😂 If your teenager takes your key or you forget it then no way are you getting up to your room. There a man sat right at the Escalators he won’t let you passed without your key at first I thought that’s nice. But on evening our teenage took are key up to the room and he would not let me up he was nasty rude and made a complete show I tried to explain until my friend appears and explains again. He give me a right telling off rude awful man.So to say I be back nooooooo I gave it a two for location but it’s very-load at night and the streets are crammed so getting back and to to this hotel is a nightmare crowds everywhere",2,Things you need to know,August 2019
165,Great hotel and great location!,"We came for an 8 night trip from the UK and I can't fault the hotel at all. We had a signature king room and it was very spacious, the room was huge and the bed was very comfy.We had a tea and coffee maker which was replaced every day by our wonderful housekeeper.The bathroom was on the small side but was plenty big enough for one of us to have a shower comfortably. The air conditioning unit was pretty loud, especially at night when we were trying to sleep but other than that the room was great. It is less than a 30 second walk to the heart of town square and is walking distance to the empire state building, grand central station and one of the entrances to central park. We will definitely be back!!",5,abbiemike1993,August 2019
166,Wayne O Reilly,Great hotel in a superb locationLiterally just off Times Square Friendly knowledgeable staff  available all hours Room very clean and spacious Particularly enjoyed the Friday afternoon resident her together in the lobby with lovely food and entertainment Definitely would stay here again,4,belgarath,August 2019
167,Great location,"There are so many positives to this hotel I don’t know where to start.Firstly, the location is perfect. Located On the corner of Times Square, perfect for the low cost broadway ticket box, the row with some of the best restaurants and 10 minutes walk from Central Park.  We have kids with us and only steps away is the Disney store, M&M store, planet Hollywood , Hard Rock Cafe and Madame Tussauds.The staff are so helpful and friendly, we arrived on a Tuesday and between 5- 7pm there is. Complimentary buffet and drinks such as house wine red / white and sangria. Also a jazz duo played which made for a great atmosphere in the art Deco lobby.We stayed in a signature family room with two bedrooms and one bathroom with a corner view of Times Square and broadway. You definitely feel in the middle of it all. The room had a safe, fridge and coffee maker. It was so very clean too.Second floor gives you access to the business suite which allows you to print off your boarding passes etc for free.Next door is a great takeout booth serving pizza and fries of evening and coffee and pastries of a morning. This allows you a cheap breakfast on the run or a cheap tea in the room.My advice is to book direct with the hotel. We booked through a third party and decided to extend our stay. Booking direct saved us so much more money.This hotel Made our holiday. You won’t be disappointed.",5,The Ollies,August 2019
168,Excellent Hotel!,"My daughter and I were looking for a reasonably priced hotel for a short trip to NYC. We chose the Edison because there was a special on at the time we were booking, and the location was perfect--just steps from Times Square and walking distance to everything we wanted to see in our limited time.I was a little bit unsure because I had read some less than favourable reviews when I was searching. I'm not sure why, because I couldn't find fault with anything about this hotel.My understanding was that the hotel was under renovation, and that some rooms had been remodeled while others had not, so I decided to book a ""signature"" room, which was an updated one, although the cleanliness of a hotel is more important to me than whether or not a room seems dated. The Edison was immaculate!We arrived early in the morning after an overnight bus trip, and had planned on just checking our bags at the desk ($1 per bag) until check-in time, but we were offered an early check-in and decided to take it. There was a fee, but it was worth it to be able to change and freshen up before heading out to see the sights. Check out can be as late as 1pm without extra fees. Had a later checkout been the same price as the early check-in I might have taken it, but it was considerably more, so we chose the $1 bag check option for the few hours we had left in the afternoon after we checked out.I was surprised how large the room was. I was expecting something very small since it's NYC, but there was lots of room, plus a sizeable closet with safe, coffee and bottled water, which were nice touches. I also liked that you had to show a room key to get on the elevators. We didn't have a view of the city, but it was very quiet and the beds were comfortable.There is a restaurant and lounge on site but we didn't use either one.Any staff that we dealt with were very friendly and helpful. We would love to return to NYC sometime, and would not hesitate to book the Hotel Edison when we do!",5,mlj773,August 2019
169,nice modern hotel in great location,hotel personnel were very helpful and room was modern and clean. beautiful view and nice amenities. close to everything especially subway stop where we could utilize from anywhere in the city. would stay there again,5,Traveler20640,August 2019
170,Great location!! ,"I would definitely stay at this hotel again. The location was perfect! You are close to time square and you can easily walk to broadway and many other places such as rockerfeller center and the subways. Our room had a safe which was a plus! The tour booth in the lobby had a map of the subway routes for manhattan which really helped us out! The only con was the bathroom around the bottom of the shower door could have been a little cleaner. It is like when the sealant starts turning dark. We really needed a fridge, but we managed without one. Otherwise it was great! The housekeeping staff was great!",4,Kimberly G,August 2019
171,16th Birthday trip for my Daughter,"The hotel was in an awesome location! We requested a signature room, and it was perfect for the two of us.  It had a newly remodeled bathroom as well.  The front desk personnel were friendly and efficient and on Fridays they have complimentary happy hour.  Though it was a little pricey, we had a great stay in a great part of town.",4,M6147WQdianef,August 2019
172,Helpful staff and great location,"My daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights from the 7 August. After a delayed overnight flight from Vegas which landed the equivalent of 3am Vegas time, very early New York time, we were resigned to not getting a room till the afternoon.We explained that we had very little sleep and my daughter wasn't feeling well and requested a phone call as soon as the room was ready.The receptionist, Melissa, was very sympathetic but advised it would be some time before a room would be ready.We ate breakfast in the restaurant and receive a call from Melissa to say a room was ready for us. This enabled us to have a few hours much needed sleep before exploring. Thank you Melissa. Management please take note.As others have mentioned the hotel is in need of some renovation but when you are out all day you just need a place to sleep.",4,SandyVF,August 2019
173,Great experience,"Excellent localization, excellent service, and comfortable room. You can access all shows by foot, close to Times Squares, restaurants, Metro and stores. Concierge to support our stay and transfer. And entire staff very willing to help.",5,Raquel K,August 2019
174,First Trip to NYC,"5 star...they made our first trip to NYC perfect!  Friendly staff, clean, great location!  Will absolutely be back and will stay here!  Booked directly with the hotel and was sent a welcome email with a thank you for booking...a credit to use when we ate at one of the restaurants (Food was great) and late check out",5,ktjzad,August 2019
175,Hotel Edison,"Stayed at the Edison twice. 6 years apart.Is now our New York City hotel of choice.Rooms, staff, facilities, location & service are top class at a economy price.Plus the Pub is amazing.1/2 block West of the top of Times Square makes the Broadway location ideal to enjoy the various shows. We really enjoyed Pretty Woman with the theater a 5 minute walk from the Edison.The Edison is our NYC home.",5,Greg Watson,August 2019
176,Read this before booking ,"We stayed at the Hotel Edison as part of a weekend bus trip to NYC. I’ve never stayed at this hotel before as I have always stayed at the nearby Marriott Marquis when in Times Square. I decided to give it a shot. When we arrived, the lobby seemed nice and promising. Our room was located on the first floor and was a total dump. I’m typically pretty easy going, but the place smelled of mold, was outdated, had visible water damage, and was dirty. I started looking for other hotels nearby, but everything was booked. After reading a review on here that mentioned someone stayed here twice and had one room that was awful and one that was nice, I thought perhaps I’d talk to the front desk. This is when my experience COMPLETELY changed. I spoke with Marcos at the front desk to voice my concerns. He immediately put us in a room on the 17th floor. From the minute we arrived on the 17th floor it was like a completely different hotel. It had new, modern upgrades, was clean, and inviting. It seems like everyone I spoke with that stayed on floors 16 and up were pleased. It seems as though the hotel started updating it from the top down and haven’t  made their way to the lower level floors. Be sure if you stay here to request a higher level floor or go elsewhere. A huge THANK YOU to Marcos for correcting the situation immediately. He is a great addition to the staff at Hotel Edison!",3,ashleytravels89,August 2019
177,The Edison is amazing !,"The Edison hotel is amazing, I would highly recommend it.  The staff are so friendly and helpful and the location is the brilliant.   Me and my sister was celebrating our birthday out there and on arrival we had a room upgrade and a bottle of wine and other goodies ! We will definitely return to the Edison .  Thank you all so much for looking after us.  I’m only sorry I never met Rommel as he was the one that sorted out our upgrade and the wine.  Absolutely fabulous.  Thanks again x",5,Debbie H,August 2019
178,My 70 th Birthday Bash,"Location, staff, and rooms all excellent.Booked two suites here with Rommel Gopez. Price was awesome for a Suite in midtown. Room was kept emaculate by housekeeping staff. Was here to celebrate my 70th birthday with friends and family from the northeast. Danny head of security offered to help us find closes subway to the World Trade Center.Instead of telling us he escorted us down the street to the subway station. I forget the name of the gentleman who checked us in, but, the process was flawless. Then we ran into Scott the hotel manager and he remembered us from our past stays at this hotel. All in all our stay at the Edison helped to make my special birthday that much more specialSo I wish to thank the entire staff and we will be back for sure.Bob Z",5,Robert Z,August 2019
179,Awful stay,"Stayed here for 2 nights, 1 and 2 August 2019.  The rooms were dull and dowdy. We paid the City tax which was expected but not a facilities tax. I asked what the tax was for and was told tea/coffee making facilities,  We didn’t have any tea/coffee making facilities, the safes were broken, we did ask about these things and were told the rooms didn’t have them. The bath was a disgrace with the enamel peeling off.  The rooms overlooked the back of the hoteI, making the rooms dark. I found the people unfriendly and unhelpful. The hotel was covered in scaffolding.  Never again.",1,Barb jo,August 2019
180,Worst hotel experience,"The fact that this place is supposed to be a “luxury” hotel is a joke. If this is what they consider luxury they need to check a dictionary. The rooms are the oldest rooms I’ve ever stayed in. The flooring is old and coming apart next to the wall. The first room we stayed in looked as though there was mildew on the ceiling. There was a hole in the bathroom door as well. When we complained they did accommodate our request and move us to another room however it wasn’t much better. The ac unit barely works in the heat of summer, so of course we had to call someone to check it out. Turns out the filter hadn’t been changed in who knows how long. And the stench of sewer coming from the bathroom is enough to make your stomach turn. When someone was asked to come fix it or at least see if there was an issue, we were told we needed to run more hot water. They sprayed some lemon scented chemical to the point I now need an air purifier to not get overwhelmed by the scent of sewer and chemical combined.When asked again to come check beings the chemical smell had died down and the sewer smell came back, they returned only to spray the same awful chemical and do nothing else. Simply covering up the problem is not fixing the problem. Not to mention we were told to begin with our room would be ready at noon and it wasn’t ready until 4. Extremely disappointed with the front staff as well. Abrasive and rude. And I would appreciate it if my luggage wouldn’t be thrown around like a sack of potatoes. If they’re remodeling and the hotel is in a condition that is not safe or able to be used then they need to either close for the entirety or not book those areas but it’s obvious they do. And another thing, what kind of room has one night stand and no microwave, fridge or coffee maker? I’ve paid less for rooms that had all the accommodations and were not considered luxury in the slightest. Don’t waste your money.",1,Whitney A,August 2019
181,Location and price are its strengths,"If you are looking for a Times Square location with a low price, this is your place. Rooms are beyond tiny, with an even smaller bathroom. Very few lights, but a comfortable bed. Nice towels in the bathroom and really nice Bigelow toiletries. Flat screen TV on a very old wall. Basically clean, safe, comfortable room to sleep and shower, not room to do anything else.",3,longingforord,August 2019
182,below average dump,"This is a below-average, disgusting hotel. The rooms look like they haven't been updated in about 10 years. The bathroom had mold around the doors painted lightly over with a thin white paint.  The 1970 sink and tub fixtures were yellowed and gross.  The vanity had only one sliding mirror and also looked like it had not been touched/updated in years.  The room's rug was dirty, tearing at the edges and immediately made it difficult to stay in the room without taking any anti-histamine.  The pics on Tripadvisor look nothing like the real room we had.  In the 6 nights there, the ice machine worked on the day we were checking out.   I don't know if the 11th floor is only for international foreigners who may not know better, but don't expect much if you are planning on staying here.  I guess you get what you pay for, but I would keep searching for a promo on a bulk booking site before ever booking this disaster again.  The reason for the 2 stars, the sheets were white and towels were OK.  Front desk staff were not overly friendly and lines were looooong around 2 o'clock check in.",2,Always4Travelling,August 2019
183,Would Stay Again,"The hotel’s best trait is its location, right next to Brooks Atkinson Theater and walking distance from Time Square. There’s also a really nice little breakfast placed called Carve just at the street corner.The aesthetics are on the older side, and there’s a slight musty smell from the old carpet. We also had to buy water as there was no refill station. At least the beds were comfortable and the bathroom worked well. It was clear that they’ve made sure the toilet amenities stayed updated.Not particularly outstanding but overall recommendable.",5,Wen B,August 2019
184,Best location,"This is our 3 rd year staying in the Edison hotel we love that it's on the door step of Times Square lovely atmosphere, staff very friendly and willing to help make ur stay as enjoyable as possible shout out to jizelle amazing lady we shall be back Annemarie and Leah limerick Ireland",5,Annemarie S,August 2019
185,"Edison hotel - Small rooms, dark and very dirty","Stayed in the Edison hotel on Times Square NYC for a week at the beginning of August 2019. Very disappointed with the family room we were given on the 6th floor it was small,dark and filthy. You couldn't swing a cat in the bathroom which again was filthy and had some mould due to no ventilation.As you can imagine the weather was hot at the time so we needed to use the air conditioning at night, it was so loud we had to turn it off again. We asked for a new room and explained our concerns but they said we would have to pay an additional charge. We refused.On the positive side, the location of the Edison hotel is perfect for exploring NYC, so if you're not fussed about having a nice clean hotel room for your stay... Book up. (Didn't really take any pictures of the room with the exception of the 1 attached)",2,Pauline M,August 2019
186,4s day visit to NYC for Yankee game and Broadway play,"The Edison is an amazing Art Deco hotel, great staff, nice rooms, and fabulous location. The NY Yankees use this hotel to house ballplayers they've called up to the majors, which should tell you something. We're looking forward to our next return trip to NYC and The Edison. Jonathan Bracco was a huge help in getting our tablet returned - we'd left it in the car that took us to the airport. And Bobby pointed us to some outstanding eateries. Again, great staff!",5,Jim K,August 2019

190,Theatre Director,"I have reviewed the hotel before. As a theatre director (casting in NYC) we have to be conscientious and stay in fair priced lodgings.  As an historic place, in historic Times Square - it can’t get better. But here’s where it does.Left my IPAD in the room aftertastes Checkiut.Called hours later. Conscientious Staff was on it: security handled beautifully, keeping me informed, And returned it. This is why I stay here.",5,Althenia,July 2019
191,Great location,"Great location, staff was not super friendly or very helpful. Seemed very put off when we would ask questions. We made a reservation over the phone and were given one rate, when I checked the reservation online the rate was much higher. I tried to get it corrected and the supervisor I spoke to told me the rate we were told didn’t exist.",3,Carrie Jo,June 2019
192,Edison Hotel,You will want to stay at the Edison Hotel. It’s a haven of rest in a wonderful part of NYC ( Times Square ). The Staff is friendly and  accommodating. Rooms are beautiful and very clean. You will feel safe. Rates are a value. What else can you want?,5,colleen230,August 2019
193,"Great location, lovely room","Stayed at Hotel Edison when visiting NYC for the first time with my teen son. Great location close to restaurants, theaters, and the lights of Times Square. The hotel restaurant was great for breakfast and the room was clean, nicely decorated, and well-sized for Manhattan. Will definitely stay again.",5,Jennifer D.,April 2019
194,Busy!,"If you want an average hotel seconds from Times Square it's fine. The first room we were given was very tired and desperately in need of updating,  when we paid extra for an upgrade it was better. The hotel reception is busier than Times Square,  if you want your hotel to be an escape from the outside world this isn't for you.",3,Paul B,July 2019
195,Good location but not much else,Stayed at the hotel in July/August Location is really good as you are round the corner from Times Square but I would say that is the only selling point Reception area is nice but rooms are tired looking and need a refresh.  Bathroom was small and in our room the tap gushed everywhere when you used it which was not great The safe in the hotel room locked us out twice due to low battery and they more or less accused us of putting in the wrong code Few occasions we tried to call reception and the phone rang out so we had to go down which was not great The WiFi is also very unreliable and annoying that when you arrive you need to pay for it so you are paying for something that doesn’t always work The only plus side apart from location was the restaurant bond 45.  We are in there every morning and food and service was always good In New York you are rarely in your room so overall it was ok but if you are looking for luxury then go somewhere else,3,Lyndsey M,July 2019
196,"Hotel Edison has a great location, great prices and mostly great service","The hotel is right off Times Square in the heart of the theater district. It's very art deco in a good way. The lobby is welcoming and the staff at the front desk very helpful. Check in was very smooth, but lines can build up.",4,matthewdmoore,August 2019
197,"Convenient location, acceptable hotel","Closely located to plenty of subway stations. It was good for Times Square, but that gets frustrating after a while as it is so busy (not the hotels fault though). Lifts were prompt and the lobby and corridors were spacious so it never felt too busy. It was nicely decorated. Staff were really friendly and chatty which was nice. They printed a ticket off for us when we booked something last minute. Wifi was free, although changeable in how well it worked. The rooms were quite dark as there were only lamps, no ceiling light in the main room. The domestic staff were very nice and kept the room clean and re-made our beds each day; however they threw away some empty bottles and cups we'd left on the side (not near a bin) which we were saving so we were not happy. This alone wouldn't stop me staying there, however. Overall, compared to another place I stayed in NY, I found this to be average, but it was perfectly acceptable and had many good points.",3,Katyphair1,August 2019
198,Steps away from the heart of Time Sqaure,Trip to NYC - we had family in from Italy - this was their 1st time to NY. I was a little skeptical the cost of the hotel was very inexpensive and while booking I couldn't secure an upgraded signature room BUT the rooms we better than expected. Free unlimited water was a plus. Onsight eats and drinks were amazing as well.,5,Dawn Fach,August 2019
199,I loved Hotel Edison!,"I loved the old architecture, the room was the spaciest and roomiest I have ever had in Manhattan and it even had a full size bathtub (hot commodity in nyc!) the staff was incredibly accommodating and helpful and the hotel exceeded expectations and was clean and lovely.

200,Amazing hotel and staff!,I can not say enough about this Hotel! Our housekeeper was phenomenal and kept our room spotless. The management and staff were great from check-in to check out. I want to personally thank  Jaclyn BohananGuest Relations Ambassador for everything she did to make sure our 4 year anniversary was amazing! She went above and beyond to help me plan the perfect anniversary surprise for my husband including upgrading our room and even provided a bottle of wine for us to celebrate! Please acknowledge her and personally thank her for me.,5,Scott A,August 2019

205,Great One day stay,"Upon checking in we were advised that we were upgraded to a suite.  The room consisted of two queen beds, living room with a pull out couch.   The room was updated and I will definitely stay here again.  In fact, I was there last year around this time.  Staff were  friendly and I liked that you had to show your room key before entering the elevators.",4,jadamom,August 2019
206,Great location and customer service.,Hotel Edison is highly recommended when you want to stay within walking distance to Time Square.

208,Loved our stay at Hotel Edison,"Staff is friendly and helpful, room dated but clean. Location is amazing, can't find a better place for the price so close to Time Square.

209,"Ok, just ok ","Pros: security at the elevator, they were always super friendly. The staff always greeted us with a smile and sincere pleasantries. The AC in the rooms worked great. The maid service was really nice and quick! I called down for a sewing kit and they had it up within 7 minutes. The hotel really is in the heart of time square but the bell guys will tell you where to find a great slice a few blocks away. Cons: the rooms smelled like sewer every time we’d flush the toilet, run the sink or shower. We kept the bathroom door shut the best we could (pocket door didn’t want to stay shut). Maybe if we staying on a lower floor it wouldn’t have been that bad?",3,Carrie B,July 2019
210,"Perfect Location, Friendly Staff!","My husband and I just checked out of Hotel Edison today after a 3 night stay to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The location was perfect! We were in walking distance to everything in Times Square and steps away from excellent food. Christian at the front desk sent us a special gift for our anniversary. Robbie delivered it to our room with a warm greeting and invited us to the hotel’s party the next day. I requested a refrigerator which was delivered with no problem, and when I needed to warm up food De’Marcus kindly offered to warm it up personally!

My accommodations were lovely and I even got to see a show or two. I definitely want to make the Edison a part of my new solo travel tradition,5,Terrill W,June 2019
213,Get what you pay for!,This is an older style hotel right near Times Square and is well located. The decor in the foyer was art deco and there were comfortable lounges. It was very busy and this was reflected in the attitude of the staff at reception. We were told we were being “upgraded” to a newly renovated room on the 17th floor but when we saw it we were doubtful that this was an upgrade as we had booked a Junior Suite. It was smaller than a cabin on a cruise ship but did have a new bathroom. Also there was no fridge which i had booked. When we approached reception again the same lady said she could send a fridge but none of the rooms came with a fridge. We questioned the size of the room compared to what we had ordered and were told the only thing we were missing was a sofa which we didn’t need. When the fridge was delivered there was nowhere to fit it except in a corner which means we had to climb over it when you were going around the bed. It only got worse! At 2am we had an engineer trying to stop the air conditioner from flooding our room. The next Morning after approaching a different receptionist we were moved to the junior suite that we had booked but no apologies for our misfortune. The bathroom wasn’t renovated but the room was 3 times the size of the 17th floor room. And in the room was the fridge that i knew i had booked. Don’t expect hospitality here.,3,cas1411,August 2019

218,Very unimpressed,"Just arrived at Edison Hotel. Room very shabby and dated. Bathroom tiny, shower either boiling hot or freezing cold - take your pick. Air con not working properly, carpet in front of air-conditioning unit soaking wet. Enginineer came to fix air con, has put towels all over the floor to soak up the water. When air con does come on it sounds like a jet engine. Best bit of all, we now have no power, so are feeling our way around in the dark - can't even recharge our phones. joy. Steer clear.",1,Daydream180082,July 2019

After forgetting my iPad they went above and beyond to not only find it, but return it to me. Two in particular are Jonathan Bracero and Jahadia Escotto of the security staff. If you’re considering a place in New York this is one I would highly recommend",5,Tim,July 2019
220,Edison Hotel is fantastic,Hotel very well located. Excelent reception. Very clean. Hotel Edison was perfect for our trip. The Hotel has 2  excelents restaurants. It's nearly Times Square. And is very quite to sleep. The concierge service is very good.,5,Victor N,July 2019
221,We went from under construction to refurbished,"After a long travel day from London we arrived to H.E. ready to sleep. Check in was good, however we enter our room and noticed the paint peeling from the ceilings, wallpaper coming off the walls and long soak in the tub turned into a quick shower due the massive chipped paint. We immediately called to request a new room only to be told we had to wait until the morning (which turned into after 3pm). We were given a few 'goodies' for our inconvenience (although that turned into a HUGE he said/she said type of situation). Eventually we received an acceptable room and finished our 2 days in NYC.",3,Rashida A,July 2019
222,Hotel Edison,"Hotel Edison was perfect for our trip. The staff make the hotel exceptional. Our front desk person, Melissa Toro, was professional, kind, and one of the first friendly faces we saw coming to NY. This was one of our first trips to the city and she had recommendations for us, checked us in fast, and was over all very helpful. The security guard and the valet were also very friendly and helpful. The rooms are large enough for us to comfortably stay, clean, and well lit.",5,Justin Lehr,July 2019
223,Best of the Best,"While I have stayed in several hotels in NYC somehow the Hotel Edison has eluded me until this past week.  The hotel is so completely charming and a must stay for anyone who wants to visit NYC and get a true pulse on the city while having the opportunity to enjoy the historic significance of Times Square's neighborhood of theaters and restaurants and their contributions to modern culture.  Friedmans, offers the best breakfast in NYC.  You'll want to make it a staple while visiting NYC!",5,Voyage788975,July 2019
224,AMAZING!!!,I stayed at the Edison for one night this weekend celebrating my best friends birthday! Our stay was amazing from start to finish. The staff is AMAZING!! Guest Agent Tex Checked us in and he was amazing even acknowledging my best friend birthday and giving us complimentary breakfast for her birthday. Sarah The Front Office Director went OVER AND BEYOND as well for us during our stay. Sarah made sure to make us feel at home and even put a beautiful birthday in the room as well for my best friend. The room was AMAZING!! Everyone we encountered made us feel welcome and at home. The breakfast was EXCELLENT! The staff there was very warm and accommodating despite how busy the place was everyone made you feel welcome and took their time with you. I would stay here again in a heartbeat. I recommend everyone stay here and make sure you have Tex check you and meet Sarah! They are the true essence of what it means to have great customer service and going over and beyond for the guest’s. They are the DREAM TEAM! See you all soon!-Danashia,5,Dee D,July 2019
225,Fab location,"Stayed here for 4 nights, the location is amazing - right on times square which does mean it's a little busy! The staff were lovely and very attentive, rooms were clean albeit a little dated. Ideal for a short stay and didnt have any complaints.",4,Cann345,August 2018
226,Not what I expected,"It's hard to judge this hotel.  When you consider the filthy condition of NYC and the exterior of the place, it's a turn off. There is a horrible stench up the street.  However, the lobby is emaculate and the staff is superb.  Then, you get to the room, expecting high-end accommodations and you're under-whelmed.  Nothing special.  In fact, less than special.  Small bathrooms, drab gray, colorless rooms, no mini-fridge or microwave.  It was clean ...no doubt housekeeping works very hard at their job and they should be applauded for their excellent work.  But, the overall impression left me feeling let down compared to other places I've stayed thru the years in considerably less commercial cities than NYC.",3,JWilliam0316,July 2019
227,Holiday ,We came here in sept a few years ago and thought it was ace. Abit old fashioned but that didnt matter. Room was lovely  bed comfy and the deli type shop next door was nice. The Edison was central right next to times square but couldn't hear any noise from the room. The doormen and staff nice and knowledgable xx,5,emma,July 2019
228,Great customer service,"I chose Hotel Edison because I wanted my granddaughters to be in the heart of the theatre district on our trip.  The best thing turned out to be the way the staff took personal interest in us when we needed some special attention.  This hotel is not only in the heart of Times Square, it also HAS a heart in dealing with the needs of its guests.  Big city charm with personalized service was just right for our trip to the Big Apple.",4,C. Draving,July 2019
229,"Hotel Edison, New York City ","You walk in, on 47th Avenue right in the middle of the theatre district, just off Times Square into the most beautiful Art Deco foyer. The receptionist was wonderful, friendly and funny.The room was lovely and in the morning we had a most delicious breakfast. I had the blintzes..amazing.So if you are visiting New York, please stay at Hotel Edison, you won’t be disappointed.",5,Judy P,July 2019
230,"Great location, lousy room","We got there and paid for early check in.  First room we walked into the AC was completely disassembled.  Went and asked for another room. This one smelled bad and the ac struggled, granted it was very hot.  Room was very dated, had peeling paint, terrible view of an alley. They said they would cancel the $114 ""resort fee"" for our troubles but they charged me $187 bucks extra anyways.  Called their billing department and left a message, never got a call back. If you decide to stay there I would recommend paying for a ""Signature""  room because apparently classic just means it hasn't been updated for a LONG time. We were very close to canceling and going across the street to the Marriott but we didn't want to pay more.  On the plus side it is a great location and the lobby is cool.",2,Tony G,July 2019
231,Confusion and unexpected fees,"I traveled to NYC with my daughter and her high school dance group.  A travel agent booked everything for the group months in advance, and charged us all for the entire trip, including the hotel.  When we checked in, we were all told that the agent had not paid for the hotel stay, and they would not give us our rooms until we gave them our credit cards.  Throughout the stay we were trying to get in touch with the travel agent to see why we were being charged twice (I saw a pending charge on my card for the entire week that first day).  She assured us that she had already paid it, and that we would not be charged by the hotel.  But when we all checked out, everyone was charged “fees” that totaled $105.00.  The whole situation was so frustrating.  The director of my daughter’s dance group says she will never use the Hotel Edison or that travel agent again.",3,vickivar,July 2019
232,Good location but some questionable security,"Stayed in June 2019 due to close proximity to Rodgers Theater & Times Square.  Hotel was nice - room was SMALL but it's NYC and you're only in it to sleep.  Not an issue.  My parents had a separate room and when running back to their room for a forgotten item them entered to find someone IN their room without their knowledge.  He claimed he was fixing something.  The next morning, someone knocked on their door and when they answered he has already walked away.  They asked if he needed something and he said something about checking to see if someone was in the room.  Very strange.  The manager said he would look into it via the hallway video and get back to us, but, he never did.  I understand if maintenance needs to be done while we are out of a room, but, we should know about it ahead of time - for our own safety.  They did credit the hotel facility fee for the inconvenience.  Still, seemed a little shady.Otherwise, it was nice, clean and perfect location for theater.  Bond 45 restaurant food was delicious and they made sure to get us in and out in time for our show.",3,ak195,June 2019
233,"Great price, can't beat the location, + comfy beds","Seriously... the price for this place is unbeatable given that it's right around the block from the Times Square building.  The rooms aren't fancy, but they are uber clean and the beds are super comfortable (which is a necessity when expending so much energy walking around the city!)  Plus it was nice that it was two QUEEN beds instead of two FULL beds offered by most places.Also I got $20 off one of their two restaurants for booking direct; I'm sure you would too.",5,Heather G.,July 2019
234,A stay at the Edison,"The Edison is a great place to stay. The owners has done major renovations and are continuing the grow. New restaurants, changing the lobby around, reception Tuesday and Friday afternoon. Employees are always smiling and helpful",5,Stay102833,July 2019
235,Hotel Edison NYC,"Absolutely loved the hotel and staff. Very clean, safe and accommodating. They were so helpful with any and all needs.  The onsite restaurants were fabulous as well!! Will definitely be staying there the next time I visit NYC!",5,Mary H,July 2019
236,Decent Hotel near Times Square,"Hotel Edison is an okay hotel.  The price is reasonable, it's close to Times Square, and the security is good.  However, many groups stay here, so the lobby is continuously noisy and busy.  The rooms are very small.  The bathroom accommodated one person only, with not much space between the sink and toilet. The furniture in our room consisted of one desk chair, and one desk well past its prime.  The bed was fine.  So, if you're looking for amenities, this is not your best choice.  If you want a decent priced room near the theatres, this is it.  There is a ticket desk in the lobby, but you're better off going out and finding better prices elsewhere.  Friedman's next door caters to groups with vouchers for breakfast; otherwise their prices are high.  Go elsewhere.",3,alumrock,June 2019
237,Terrible place,"The only advantage of this hotel is a very close proximity of the Times Square (1min) otherwise not sure how they got the their stars. AC noisy as a hell, rooms size of the shoes box, while seating on toilet seat your head is nearly in the sink, Wi-Fi most of the time doesn't work, staff unpleasant and unhelpful. Paid luggage storage 😕. The only nice people in the hotels are cleaners and the doormen. Wouldn't recommend especially if travelling with kids....",1,lemurzyca,July 2019
238,"Great rooms, fantastic food and terrific service","The rooms were nice size and reasonably priced, the location was perfect for walking to theaters and Central Park. Friedman's just off the lobby offers incredible food and every item can be made Gluten Free! Adele at the concierge desk was incredibly knowledgable and helpful.",5,KCD,July 2019
239,Overnight For A Broadway Show!,My son and I arrived 2 hours prior to check in and were allowed to have our room early.  Being in Times Square this was a godsend because we got to put our bags down.  We also stopped back a lot to drop off our purchases to our room.  My son was given a teddy bear and coloring book by Robbi in the lobby because he is the nicest guy in NY!  Our room was clean and smelled good.  There was a nice assortment of complimentary soaps and water bottles in our room.  Our room was historic but updated.  We had no issues with noise at all even though I expected some.  We slept very well.  Check out was a breeze and the price was excellent.  I'll be back!,5,Sara G,July 2019
240,Hotel Edison NYC,"Great place to stay right in the middle of the Times Sq/Theater District NYC.  clean well appointed rooms and great housekeeping staff, hopefully you'll get our lady on the 7th floor H. Singh.  She is fantastic, so courteous, efficient and professional.  She always had our room cleaned and restocked by the time we came back from sightseeing.",5,Jason Anthony O,July 2019
241,Wonderful,The Edison and Danny OBrien are incredible...My fiancée and I had an absolute blast in NYC. The Edison hotel and entire staff were amazing. In particular Danny from the  executive team. He made us feel like family.  Our trip to New York was beyond words thanks to Danny.We will be back soon...,5,Diva,July 2019
242,You’ll love your stay here...we did!!!,"Staff extremely friendly and professional from desk clerk to bell hops to security guards to housekeeping.  Friendly greetings everyday by everyone.  We had to extend our stay due to hurricane back home...everyone was concerned about our families and our homes.  Made us feel very well cared for in a stressful situation.   The Hotel Edison is in the best location for Broadway plays (Hamilton just across the street) and Times Square is 1/3 block away....  very safe location.  We were also there during the recent blackout....lobby opened for anyone to sit an wait.  I highly recommend the Hotel Edison.  Rooms comfortable and very clean,too!   Hoping you pick the Hotel Edison for your next trip to NYC!",5,Sally S,July 2019
243,Wonderful location,"Very close to Time Square, easy to find, room is a bit small but nice and clean. If you are looking for a hotel close to Time Square, this is the one! Hotel staff are very nice and storing luggage is just 1 dollar.",4,KojaY,July 2019
244,Amazing place to stay!,"Great hotel! Everything was beyond expectations,My girlfriend and I stayed at the Edison hotel for a couple of days, and we both had a great time.The staff there are wonderful, especially Roger, Johnathon Bracero and Danny OBrien. Felt really taken care of!Thank you for a great stay!",5,Jon.dom.13,July 2019
245,Never stay here again ,This was our first ever trip to New York from the UK. We had booked this trip with a travel agent and had paid for the flights hotel stay and transfer in full in April. I had looked at the hotel and all its terms and conditions before we arrived. So when checking in I knew they would want to take a swipe of my credit card to cover any incidentals during our stay. The staff were very friendly and polite. I was impressed with the security checking cards by the lift to ensure only guests went to the rooms. We were allocated a room on the 11th floor. This was totally unsuitable as there was work being carried out in the room next to ours. I went to the front desk and complained about our allocated room. We were allocated a room on the 14th floor. This room was very small and not to the standard shown in the photos. It was very tired and worn out looking. The carpet needed to be changed and the whole room needed to be completely renovated. When checking out on 13th July I knew we had not run up a bill and our room had been paid for prior to us arriving. I asked the concierge for a receipt but was told they only issue receipts if you had a bill to pay. When we returned to the UK on Sunday 14th July I looked at our credit card account and discovered over £713 had been charged to our credit card on 8th July and a further £142+ had also been charged to the credit card on 13th July after we had left. I emailed the hotel twice but I am still waiting for a response from the hotel. The staff at the Hotel are very polite and helpful.,1,blackratEssex,July 2019
246,Fantastic,We loved this hotel! We were placed on the 21st floor. Our room was clean and updated. We had one problem with the air conditioning fan not working but notified the front desk upon leaving for the day. When we arrived back at the hotel later that night our air conditioning was working properly and we never had another problem with it. The hotel is very busy at times which in my opinion should be expected as it is in the heart of times square. All of the staff were friendly and helpful. The location is simply amazing. So thankful we stayed here as we looked at numerous places to stay. Would definitely stay again.,5,Alana H,July 2019
247,Requested room change,"Myself and my wife both in our 60's decided to take a 5 night break (3rd June 2019) at the Hotel Edison and booked in via Thomas Cook Travel. We paid slightly over £300 per night and could have stopped at the Hilton or other well known Hotels for the same price but liked the idea of a 1931 Art Deco themed Hotel and the location so close to Times Square.  We checked in, but had to wait over 30 minutes as a large group were in front of us, no problem we were just unlucky with the timing. We were allocated room 1047 on the 10th floor. To say we were disappointed is an understatement. We never expected views of Central Park or even the Empire state building, but the back of the hotel overlooking the air con units for £300 a night ?. We could have always have closed the blinds but the interior was far worse. It would be an insult to compare it to a cheap Bed & Breakfast in Blackpool.  The room was so outdated and scruffy even the pictures do not do it justice, The paintwork looked like it had not been touched in decades, faded cream and chips  and scuffs from years of suitcases and such. No storage for clothes at all just an old dingy cupboard for suitcases and the ironing board. The cheap shoddy brown carpet had 2 burn marks to the shape of an Iron. The wall paper was peeling at the edges. The electrics sockets had ill fitting front covers and were loose, the cables were run in surface mounted plastic covers, clearly done after the last time it had been decorated. Infact my garage is decorated to a better standard!. The Bathroom really did look like it was an original, clean but so old. The finishing touch was the waste pipe that run full height in the corner and wrapped in grey foam insulation and tied with gaffer tape, really stylish!...  After a long flight we were speechless and went back down to ask for a room change or we would have to check out.  Again we stood in the queue for over 30 minutes and were finally served by a man called Christian, very polite and very very apologetic, I explained it was the worst room I had ever stayed in and could not stay there.  After several minutes he apologised and said all rooms were booked out but he could move us the next morning. We agreed and went back to room 1047. True to his word next morning we were handed the keys to 1805 a refurbished room on the 18th floor.  The room was large, very clean, comfy large bed and a clean bathroom. However first time the toilet was used in backed up, clearly it was blocked. I called room service as we were going out for the day and they sent 2 maintenance guys as we were going out of the room. We went sight seeing for the day, got back and guess what, the toilet blocked  again. Rang reception and they promised to get someone to unblock it that evening while we were out.   Next morning and no surprise, the toilet blocked again, I went down to reception this time and asked for the duty manager, I explained that I own a family business that designs and installs bathrooms and if their maintenance guys do not know how to unblock a toilet I will show them if they bring the equipment up to the room.  I was assured it would be sorted on this third attempt.   I did check it as soon as I got back to room and tried flushing a few pieces of toilet roll and it was still backing up as if partly blocked still.... So for the last day we used toilets at Restaurants and the Hotel toilets..  When we checked out online using the TV function we noticed a charge for $143, so I went down to the lobby to question what facilites we had used,,,, AGAIN a 30 to 40 minute queue but as I was about to be served I was asked by a Man who I think was the ""Lobby manager"" asking if he could assist. I asked what was the $143 he said it was a charge to cover use of the gym or sauna, I explained I did not use the gym or sauna and if it was a fixed charge for everyone in the hotel then it should be included in the room charge.  He said that facilites were an added cost!...  I asked is a working WC included in the room cost or is that a facility too,  because for the last 4 days I did not have one that worked!. At that point he handed to invoice to the desk clerk and said take this off the bill for this gentleman and apologised for any problems we had experienced.... At all times I found every single member of the staff polite, friendly and helpful,,,,,,,I understand that hotels go through refurbishments but how can anyone expect the public to pay top end prices for such outdated and scruffy rooms.  Regardless of where in the World you live, we all know the difference between Value for Money and being overcharged for third rate facilities..  If we had been given room 1805 from the start and we had a toilet that flushed properly I would have been raving about how good this hotel, its location and its staff.  I have ( hopefully) attached some pictures of the first out dated room.",2,Jim D,June 2019
248,Great hotel,"Hotel Edison was the perfect hotel for our NYC vacation. It is an older hotel, but that adds to the charm. We were greeted by friendly doormen when we pulled up in our taxi. We were able to store our bags for $1/each since it was too early to check in. We were so close to Times Square, restaurants,  shops, and bars. We felt very safe at this location; they have staff posted at the elevators to make sure only guests are going up to the rooms.The room was very clean, and cleaned well each day. We would definitely stay here again",5,jawagner2018,July 2019
249,Outstanding Customer Service,"My sister and I were in New York staying at the Hotel Edison when the blackout occurred on Saturday, July 13th.  Athough we missed out seeing the play we had planned on going to, I have to say how wonderful the staff and management of the hotel were in handling the blackout crisis.  Management gave non-stop updates as they knew them, had staff handing out bottles of water to the hundreds of hotel guests sitting in the lobby and hallways.  I was especially impressed with the staffs' calm demeanor and courtesy throughout this ordeal.  Special mention to Rommel Gopez, Director of Guest Relations...he was an inspiration to us all!!!",5,PLM,July 2019
250,Will stay here again!,The Hotel Edison was a great choice for my family and me when we visited New York City. The hotel has a very retro vibe to it. The staff are very friendly and helpful with any request we had. The hotel at night was very quiet despite being near Times Square. The room was always clean when we returned from being out during the day. I have no complaints about this hotel would recommend highly to anyone visiting New York City!,5,Evelyn Caffrey,October 2018
251,Not happy,"The staff is amazing the hotel is very clean and is located in a fantastic spot.  Here’s what we experienced first of all air-conditioning broke 19th floor 80° they told me to shut the air off for one hour at midnight, also try to call down to the front desk phone was broke, had to go downstairs three times, The power went out for five hours they told us we could go up to the room which was 19 floorsbut don’t use toilet or any water, The sink in the shower would build up about 2 inches of water in the shower  and the sink also did the same thing backed up,we travel extensively we have been to Puerto Rico,Nicaragua and Bahamas  and stayed in the least expensive hotels and never had a problem. This hotel seems to have a lot of pride in themselves seems they don’t offer anything no compensation no free dinners and I’m not asking for anything for free maybe a little compensation for the crap we’ve been through not one time has anybody offered us anything so if you check in at this hotel make sure you go up to your room and check everything out before you give them your card!!! They did move us to a new room which was smaller  and said that they’ll just go ahead and rent the other room out ,To somebody else!!!!!! And if they come back and try to bash this review,it’s only to protect the manager",2,George G,July 2019
252,Vacation,"The staff at hotel Edison in NY was so nice and helpful. Housekeeping was very nice and our room was clean. Security was very comforting to know they will not let anyone upstairs without a room key. They were every where to help with anything you Needed. My granddaughter left her laptop charger and I called 2 days later and they had it and they are shipping it back to me.  Jonathan Bracero, has kept me informed of finding it and shipping it back. I would suggest to everyone to stay here. Bond 45 is in the hotel. Best food in town!",5,Connie H,July 2019
253,Best Hotel,"I've stayed in a lot of hotels and the customer service here is excellent. Starting with the valet who picked up our car and bags down 7th Avenue as we couldn't pull up to the entrance due to a street fair, right through the professionalism of the staff during a blackout. We couldn't check in on time due to a premier member staying late and they generously comped us a few drinks while we waited.  Then I tore something in my knee and the brought me a wheelchair and bags of ice. A huge thank you to Savan, Fernando and all the others who helped! Now, let's talk about the property. In a word, gorgeous! The tree lined terraces where you can eat and drink are divine and provide a luxurious oasis.  You would never know you were in Times square! The rooms are sleek and stylish. I want to live here!",5,Katie A,July 2019
254,Fantastic 3 night break,"A very nice classic New York hotel. The rooms are smallish but comfortable. The location is second to none, being situated right next to Times Square and the Theatre District. Used the attached Bond 45 eaterie which was very good for food and drinks. The hotel staff were polite and helpful. There is a small tourist information desk with the staff providing a wealth of information. Bought open top bus tickets and show tickets from this desk.",4,Nick,July 2019
255,Exceeded my expectations,"Coming to this hotel for just the location, to be surprised by the great service. We arrived to this hotel at 4 pm to find a long que for check in. Surprisingly this que were checked in their rooms in only 10 minutes or less by the plenty of personnel working in this hotel. The hotel is huge and has a marvelous lobby that hosts a happy hour from 5-6 pm on Tuesdays and Fridays. The room was surprisingly very large and spotlessly clean. It has the feeling of home. Our room was signature king room, that means a large room with a huge bed, a closet that contains an iron and a bathrobe, a TV and a desk. Then a living room with a sofa bed with another closet that contains exactly the same as the one in the bedroom, another TV, a safe, a refrigerator and a coffee machine. There was a large and modern bathroom. There was a lot of windows. They greeted us with a pack of nuts upon arrival in the room. Location was superb to walk everywhere in New York. You will not need the subway as much. A subway with line E to JFK is just 2 blocks away. The great gain is also proximity to theaters (just in the back of the hotel), the area is very safe as it is awake and busy to early morning. Taking the elevator is secured by showing the room card. Staff were always smiling to guests. A lot of food options around. WiFi was very good.I really loved this hotel and found it to be one of my favorite accommodations in the last 3 years.",5,MaiMoaaz,July 2019
256,"Amazing, again!","Scott Geres does not disappoint!  We came in exhausted from an overseas flight, the front desk staff were extremely efficient, friendly and sincere. Having stayed here previously, we had a suite on this trip. The sitting room was charming and included a welcome basket full with fruits, sweets and a bottle of wine. The bedroom had 2 queen beds, perfectly made with fresh linens, super comfy, flat screens in both rooms with working remotes. The bathroom was clean and nicely appointed with C.O. Bigelow toiletries and plenty of them.On the night we were there, it happened that parts of Manhattan had a blackout. Within minutes of the lights going out, a safety announcement came across with instructions, the safety manager was cool, calm and collected and most of all polite and concise. The entire staff from front end, to security and maintenance were beyond accommodating and respectful. Staff was on each floor assisting anyone who needed, offering water, helping folks get to their bags if they needed medication or general assistance.It was beyond impressive.  It seemed to be a fine oiled machine in this case of emergency, everyone knew how to handle their jobs and to keep us informed. Mr. Geres truly has his staff providing their guests with  the best possible experience even in an unfortunate fluke situation. This is just another example of why The Edison Hotel is my go-to and why I recommend it to anyone staying in Manhattan.",5,francesof3,July 2019
257,Room was in poor shape,Before this trip I looked at all available room photos to be sure of what we were getting. I assure you my room wasn’t on any website. I forgot to get pictures of the rest of the room once my daughter was awake but I did get a few of the bathroom photos. We won’t stay here again. Who wants to be barefoot on those floors? Didn’t even have a working toilet paper holder.,1,KatieB,July 2019
258,Weekday get away,My wife booked this hotel On Tuesday July 9th. 2019 Checking in was not so easy and this  hotel has the worst customer service in the city I have ever had. We were given a room that was still occupied when we went back to the lobby and told the manager she brought my wife to the desk and the girl was questioning my wife like she was a criminal. We originally asked for a room not close to the elevator. Anyone want to guess where we were? Yes across from the elevator. Security is a problem the place is small and homeless people try to sneak in. Bottom line not worth risking your safety for the same price as a name brand hotel.,2,John R,July 2019
259,Regret staying in this hotel. Very bad service!,"Staff are not accommodating, especially the bellman. I am a Filipino solo traveler. I felt that i was discriminated by those men. Due to the fact that i have arrived the hotel early  i have requested the staff to keep safe my luggage. After an hour of walking in the streets of Manhattan i have to come back and take something out of my luggage. The bellman was not accommodating and displayed his character as if his disturbed of helping me. The hotel promised that they will send me an email once my room is available and as expected i did not get any email!!! I came back to the hotel around 4pm already and finally they confirmed the room is ready. The receptionist pointed me to the very “unhelpful” bellman to assist me on brining my luggage to my room. Would you believe the bellman didnt even bother helping me carry my luggage?! He even told me “i will help you if you ask me to?  Unbelievable!! This is the worst service. I have seen how they treat other nationalities which is totally not same with how they treated me! I call upon the management of this hotel to please train your staff to learn how to respect and accommodating as how they are expected to be. I regret staying in this hotel.",1,Juna,July 2019
260,The Edison Is Electric!,"My wife and I go to NY twice a year to indulge our passion for the theatre. We always stay at the Edison for a variety of reasons. For show-goers, it's a dream because it's literally in the heart of the Theatre District--80% of Broadway houses (and a number of off-Broadway as well) are within three blocks of either exit. (Plenty of great restaurants as well, including our beloved Sardi's.) For another, it's very reasonable as Manhattan hotels go; the cheapest room at the nearby Marriott Marquis is more than twice what the Edison costs. And the staff is beyond friendly. We've gotten to know several of them, and they're always delighted to see us (and vice versa). The rooms are clean and comfortable (the housekeepers change the sheets every day, even when we tell them it's not necessary), and if there is a problem, it's fixed right away. Obviously, people go to NY for a variety of reasons, but if you intend the stay mid-town and you're not a billionaire, I can't think of a better place to unpack your bags.",5,Michael S,April 2019
261,NYC weekend,"Had a wonderful stay at this hotel! All the staff (front desk,concierge desk, security,cleaning) were super friendly and helpful. Our signature room was beautiful and spacious by NYC standards. Had a small problem  with our black out shades but they were there to fix it within 5 min of reporting the problem.The location was fantastic, steps from times square and theatres. We could here the noise from TS being so close but it wasn't  loud enough to interfere with sleep in the extremely comfortable bed.We will definitely  stay here again and recommend it to our friends!",5,PFleming,July 2019
262,"Hotel with a friendly, helpful staff and great location.","Staff went overboard to make sure we enjoyed our stay.   Security is a plus at this hotel.  You must show your room key to a security guard to use the elevators.   Staff members Rommel and Rodney showed us extra attention to help us have the best NYC experience.   When they saw one of us in the lobby they would come up and ask how things were going.   Location is perfect for catching the subway, walking to shows and great places to eat.  Friedman's has great food and The Rum Bar has a good variety of craft cocktails and live music later in the evening.  Both are located inside the hotel.  Room was comfortable and clean.",5,Curtis P,July 2019
263,Summer Get Away,"Great hotel located in the middle of several theaters and near Times Square. The rooms are a little small, but have been updated. We had a room with a terrace, so we were able to sit outside and drink coffee every morning. The staff was very friendly and helpful, esspecailly our housekeeper Rose. She spoke to us every day and asked if we needed anything. We will definitely stay here again!",5,Tim E,June 2019
264,Great location to stay in Times Square & Great Staff,"We went to NY during 4th of July week and left this following Tuesday. Room was clean, cool, comfortable and quiet. Great mattress. After touring the city all day good sleep was essential! One of your amazing staff members stood out the most to me; if I could recall, his name is Robbie Moss. Mr. Moss made sure my stay was 10 times better than excepted. If there were any concerns I may have had, he made sure they were handled with no hesitation.  He also gave us tips and helped us find our way through the city and nice restaurants to visit during our stay. To know that they are people like Mr. Moss here at the Edison Hotel who cares about their guest made me really happy. I will most definitely be visiting again.",5,Shakera,July 2019
265,Great Location,If you want to immerse yourself in the middle of it all in NY this is the place. Great service and a great location.  Two restaurants right in site and just steps away from Times Square. It was a fantastic location for our first visit to NYC.,5,JayceeSaidSo,July 2019
266,A Wonderful Time,"We went to NY during July 4th week.  Arrived the day of the Pride Parade and there through the 4th celebrations.  The location of the hotel was AMAZING. Across the street from the Broadway shows and Time Square.  You must keep in mind this hotel was built in the 30's.  If you are looking for sparkling brand new, this is not for you.  If you are looking for clean and great staff and great location this is it.  The staff was very nice and welcoming.  Fehat Begolli was simply wonderful to us and helped us find our way through the city.  I will be going back and staying there again.",4,Patty M,July 2019
267,Fantastic city stay in Times Square,"Room was clean, cool, comfortable and quiet.  Great mattress.  After touring the city all day good sleep was essential!  All staff helpful and happy.  The man who arranged our shuttle departure was attentive to our needs and we got to the airport in plenty of time.",5,susan and christopher martz,July 2019
268,The room was not what was advertised,"I went to NYC for business and got a “deal” through TripAdvisor for the hotel Edison. The pictures online look sparkly and new but the room that I was placed in could only be described as “decorated with a coffin feel”. The toilet was scratched up and not fully clean, it was noisy all night because the ac was loud and frightening and the sheets were scratchy and had a cigerette stain. I paid a resort fee for something that could only be described as one step down from a cheap motel. I travel to NYC a lot and I won’t be taking the TripAdvisor deals nor will I be going to the hotel Edison.",2,Bohemia123,July 2019
269,Terrible accommodations,"Traveled to New York City in June 2019 and stayed at the hotel Edison .... should have brought a tent!  The homeless guy on 45th street had a cardboard box bigger than our room.  It was 10x10 with a 5x3 washroom.   You couldn’t sit anywhere only on the bed and two people could not walk around. Terrible conditions for $250 US per night and being from Canada we paid way too much for this garbage.  Also the bellman should be taught some manners .... he was rude and abrupt .... cleaned shaven guy , light hair.  I asked for a cart to bring our luggage to our room after we checked in and he was ignorant and said nope carry it yourself.  A-hole.   View from the closet (room ) was a series of air conditioning units !   We asked if we were in the new area and were told yes. If this is new I wouldn’t want to see the old .......the restaurant and bar there is a money grab on tourists ....$60 for just a usual breakfast !!!!   Of course  all of this area is very expensive.  We knew that but come on you charge us over $300 CAD for a room and we didn’t even get a coffee maker in the room!!  This will be the first ad last trip here.  Only good thing was a small bar called Jimmys Corner where you could get a beer for $4..... bit of a dingy spot but service was friendly.  Bring from NL I guess we expect everyone to be like us ..... we treat each and tourists alike .... exceptional.",1,Newfie-Copper,June 2019
270,Cosy sanctuary in Times Square,"We paid a bit extra for an upgraded room (family suite), 2 bedrooms with very comfortable beds and a nice sized bathroom greeted us. Helpful but busy staff and most excellent location! Make sure when you book you request a renovated room as rumours have it the old style room is booked out at the same price as renovated. One thing we didn't like was the air-conditioning unit in our room was loud, so loud we turned it off at night in fact.We used the valley parking at $70 a day because parking would otherwise be a nightmare. But the hotel location is IDEAL for walking day tours of NYC and if you're into seeing a show on Broadway. Would definitely stay again.",5,SavvyTravelNZ,July 2019
271,Loved it,We really enjoyed our stay. The hotel room was so clean and had enough space for the three of us. The location was excellent and staff were very accommodating and friendly. We recommend the hotel and will defiantly return soon.,5,AbbyAbby2007,July 2019
272,Theatergoers dream,Probably 15 of the Broadway shows are located within 2 blocks of the hotel.  The beds were comfortable with great linens and fluffy towels.  Free wifi and complimentary water to stock in my mini fridge is such a treat after sightseeing during the day.  A wine and cheese reception twice a week makes you feel appreciated and like family!  Adequate elevators to handle patrons and a very nice restaurant with an ample breakfast buffet served in addition to menu items. There customer relations department is amazing and they have taken GREAT care of me.  a half block from Times Square and subways in all directions a short walk away.  Will always stay at the Edison.  Love this place.,5,Scott B,June 2019
273,Another Excellent Stay at the Hotel Edison in NYC,"I just returned home from my 20th trip to New York with 18 consecutive stays at the Hotel Edison.  This is my favorite hotel for many reasons.  First of all, the security is the tops!  You cannot access the elevators without showing your room key 24 hours a day!  There is absolutely no chance anyone can wander in off the street and gain access to the guest rooms.  Security is also strategically placed around the lobby as well.  The restaurants at the Edison are both excellent.  I ate at both.  Each morning the Bond has a delicious breakfast buffet for $24 that includes bagels, cream cheese, smoked salmon, homemade breads with jam/marmalade, waffles, scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes (perhaps the best I've ever had), fresh fruit including berries, and more!  You can skip lunch after this!  There is also a bar called The Rum House on the premises which had a 5 piece jazz band Sunday night.  My room was nice and the lobby of the hotel was beautiful.  In the lobby on Tuesdays and Fridays there is a manager's reception that includes live entertainment and complimentary wines and various food.  The location of the hotel cannot be beat.  It is at 228 West 47th Street and also has access to 46th street.  You are literally just a couple minutes walk away from shows like Dear Evan Hansen, Come From Away, To Kill a Mockingbird, Hamilton, etc.  All staff members I encountered were friendly and helpful.  I must especially compliment Justina at check in.  She checked me in on a few other occasions and is very good at her job!  My favorite person is the Director of Guest Relations, Rommel.  He is very visible and obviously enjoys his job very much!  He makes visitors feel valued and important.  He circulated chatting with everyone during the Manager's reception.  I was especially surprised that he was able to refer to several guests by their names!  He is truly an excellent ambassador for the Edison.  I cannot recommend this hotel highly enough.  If you are travelling to New York, you cannot go wrong choosing the Edison.",5,Keith W,July 2019
274,Great for a Broadway trip,"Stayed here for 4 nights in July.PROS: Location is excellent if you are planning on seeing Broadway shows. Security was a nice addition. Our room on the 20th floor was recently updated. Beds were so comfortable. One night the A/C barely worked, the other nights it was fine. Room was spacious. We had breakfast at Friedman's every morning, and also ate at Bond 45 and both were really great restaurants located right inside the hotel. Loved the art deco look of everything.CONS: Only one small mirror in the bathroom which was challenging for 2 women. Would suggest they invest in an additional mirror for the room!If you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs or do not get a room with an adjoining door in it. It is no fault of the hotel, but we had very loud neighbours who kept us up til 1:30am every night because we could hear everything through the adjoining door. Didn't hear anything from the room on the other side of us where there wasn't an adjoining door. Didn't really hear any traffic noise.",4,acinbc,July 2019
275,Edison Hotel,"Located around the corner to Times Square, handy for all the sites. Helpful staff and clean rooms. Our only problem was we booked a twin room with TUI but were allocated a double, however a roll out bed was provided. I can recommend the Irish bar located a few doors away.",4,Phil C,June 2019
276,They have my business and forever thanks.,"On my way to celebrate my birthday, I was involved in a hit and run accident. The police came to take my statement, but half way through they left saying they would be back. I was shaking. I waited for the police for 2 hours. Then decided I would check in to my hotel I could see from the accident site. I was visibly distressed. Robbie greeted me and listened to my crying mess of a story. At that point he called over Danny Obrien. Danny helped me get checked in to my room without waiting. He then proceeded to call the police to get them to come back since I needed a report for my insurance. Danny was my advocate to make sure I had everything I needed with the police and for my car. That day I was at a loss and was ready to just go home. Danny helped me when I thought I was completely alone dealing with what felt impossible. He called the police over 10 times since they waited 6 hours to send someone to finish my report.On top of all of that, I got to my room and there was a little gift bag from Robbie and Danny to make the day a little brighter. It has been a week since the accident and Danny has checked in with me twice. Today he is making sure I have a report and everything I need for my insurance. I honestly will never stay at another hotel in NYC again. The Edison has won a place in my heart and I will tell everyone how incredible they were to me especially Danny Obrien. I can not imagine how differently my week would have turned out without him.",5,Tina R,July 2019
277,"Quiet, Clean and Updated","Our experience with Hotel Edison was close to perfection. For my family of 4 I booked a room with 2 queens and we somehow ended up with a 2 room family suite (Rm 1029). This make a huge difference when teenagers don't have to share a bed. The suite was big, updated and had a nice view. The shower was huge. I'd read reviews that 'only the upper floors' were renovated, but we were only on the 10th floor and the room felt new. We also never heard any exterior noise despite being near Times Square.The hotel itself is interesting architecturally with a beatiful lobby. The only misses are 1) We were lazy one morning and ate in the hotel restaurant. My $17 pancakes were dry and crumbly and no one's breakfast at the table was above average.   2) This is my last time staying near Times Square. We did it to show the kids, but there are much nicer, more genuine, less smelly and probably friendlier neighbourhoods on Manhatten. This isn't a comment on the fine staff at the Edison - more on the thousands of hawkers and scammers trying to make a buck off you.If you do choose Times Square though, you can't go wrong with Hotel Edison.",5,AjaxTraveller26,July 2019
278,Awesome,"This hotel was one of the most beautiful hotels in Midtown Manhattan. It was clean and all the workers were genuinely nice, especially this guy name Robbi. He was awesome, you must meet him. We will book this hotel again!!!",5,Dr. Coco,July 2019
279,Wonderfu Hotel!!,We were on a bus trip and this is the hotel we stayed at.  It was wonderful!!  We were on the 14th floor and had a great view.  The beds were comfy and the shower was very nice.  Towels were nice and fluffy!!,5,Dar S,July 2019
280,Great location...but ...,"Our family of four stayed  at Hotel Edison for 3 nights to explore NYC before our cruise.  The location of this hotel is simply magnificent! It is close to everything...Times Square is just steps away, and there is easy access to the subway! The lobby is visually impressive  and the personal attention upon entering the door and during check in was impressive. It left us smiling from ear to ear! But...We were given our keys to our standard room and the elevator quickly took us to the 5th floor. Our room simply was not represented by the pictures on their website.  The room was drab and looked like it hasn't been painted in ages.  The ceiling had peeling paint and brown spots. The bathroom smelled just a bit musty and the tape holding the insulation on the pipe was hard to get past.  Our room was directly across the hall from the ice machine and since our room was conveniently located among about 10 rooms being used by a teen age international  field trip ( you could tell because blue painters tape was on the outside of all their doors) we heard that Ice machine and the teens' loud voices all night long! ( Why would you place our family room right in the middle of this group of youngsters?) This was certainly not the room pictured on their website!  The air conditioning worked very well but was so loud it was hard to sleep.The wifi?  Wait...what wifi? We couldn't get on it ever! On the positive side, the bathroom products were wonderful! My daughter and I loved the conditioner! I understand the hotel is older and historic...that's actually why we chose to book the Hotel Edison, but perhaps they should represent their rooms accurately.  And if we happened to get a room that was not refurbed as the ones in the pictures...perhaps a cheaper rate would have made this room easier to swallow.  Long story short...Great location and conditioner. I would never book this hotel again for my family.",3,Jami S.,June 2019
281,LOVE Hotel Edison!!,I just returned from staying at the Hotel Edison for six nights. I absolutely love this place! The location couldn’t be better. So close to everything in Times Square. Plus it was super close to my son’s dance audition. We were able to walk everywhere. All the Broadway shows are right there. Really makes you feel like a local with the location. The room was fabulous. Much larger than what you would generally find in New York. Beds are super comfortable. The cleaning staff was super nice and so helpful. I love the security that the hotel provides. The staff was very attentive to the guests. A BIG shout out to Rommel and Robbi for being so amazingly fabulous to my son and I! These two went above and beyond to make our stay memorable! Can’t wait to see you both again! I am all done looking for another hotel to stay at when I am in the city. Hotel Edison is it for me! ❤️,5,Heidi,July 2019
282,Rethink your decision,"I spent a few days at the Hotel Edison in Times Square last week and had some issues.  First, my only positive was the location. Within walking distance to many of the “must see” things in the city was great!..it was the remodeling project in the next room to ours at 9 a.m. that I had an issue with, and of course the 2 huge cockroaches I had to chase down and dispose of was of course an issue, and that pricey $57 “resort fee” that they surprise you with on your bill...so, hammers pounding on the adjoining wall in the morning, the cockroaches and the resort fees would definitely make me rethink my stay there.",2,Mjspicasso,July 2019
283,Avoid this hotel,"The Efison is really in need of a total renovation. All interiors are old and ugly, but worst the airconditioning system is ancient and not anle to cool down the rooms, and the electricity keeps wuitting. The people working in the reception are slow and lacking in qualifications, and the breakfast in the restaurant is both disgusting and expensive.",1,Ulla O,July 2019
284,Enjoyable Stay ,"The hotel was in prime location literally just off Time Square. The room was ideal, bathroom was a bit on the small size but wasn’t a problem. Nice views of other buildings near by. Housekeeping did a brilliant job every morning of our room. One thing I can fault is the WiFi as it didn’t work through out our 6 night stay. Overall I would stay here again.",4,Razorlight88,June 2019
285,"Good overall experience, nice hotel","Room adequately sized, beds very comfortable, bathroom a little on the small size, but do not spend much time in there anyway, our room was generally quiet.Reception area a little chaotic at times, but attractively presented, staff all very helpful. A great location for New York Central areas, with all areas, easily reached",5,chris,June 2019
286,Fantastic hotel for all NYC events!,"I’ve now stayed at the Edison hotel for NYE and for World Pride. During both of these times, the area is filled with people, events and fun. Each time the Edison put together fun Edison hour get togethers for their guest. The Edison hotel is clean, quick to tend to their guests, and have great concierge services. My only “negative” experience was the lack of WiFi connection, but it was more due to the amount of people in the area and not the hotel itself. This is my go-to choice when staying around Times Square. It’s nearby many “tourist” spots, safe, and clean.",5,mrstrishkoester,July 2019
287,DO NOT GO,"Worst hotel ever. I’ve been traveling a lot and this one was not a good experience. First of all, you have to know that you can have an old room even if you pay the same price as a new one. If you have an old one, make sure your door locks properly because ours wasn’t and people came into our room during the night twice ! The staff was almost saying that it was our falt. Expensive for what it is. U can find better near in Times Square ! I will never come back.",2,Narifo,July 2019
288,Helpful and very pleasant staff,"I have been staying at the Edison Hotel for several decades and keep returning to this hotel primarily because of the helpful and pleasant staff.  The bellman are ambassadors for the hotel  that make the guests feel welcome.  I commend Tommy, Humberto, Kevin, Charlie, Ferhat and Larry the Captain for being very friendly and accommodating, always pleasant to visit with and share stories.  Jahira, working security, is always delightful.  Tony at the front desk is also great.  I have had pleasant interactions with others as well.  The bottom line is that these individuals represent the hotel extremely well and are always willing to be helpful.  Besides the wonderful staff, the Edison is nicely located in Times Square, convenient for access to the Broadway theaters.",5,timriley7,June 2019
289,Very helpful!,"My dad lost his phone in uber, and just realize when he was back in Brasil. Jahadia and Danny received the phone from the uber driver and kept it in save, till we get it back.I am very gratuful for your attention, Jahadia and Danny.",5,Paula B,February 2019
290,Great hotel & Fantastic Location,Stayed here for St Patricks day celebrations 2018. Hotel was lovely beautifully decorated and really big. You literally walk out the hotel and you are right in the middle of Times Square which is awesome. Room service is delivered by a restaurant and not the hotel kitchen. Staff are very helpful and Concierge also. They advised us the best way of getting back to the airport. Toilet was a bit small but rooms are enough to accomdate a part of 3. Not sure if there are bigger rooms. Would defo return to the Edison in the future.,4,Paul Waugh,March 2019
291,3 night vacation,"Recently stayed at this hotel which was prebooked by our travel agent. It was well located being very close to Times Square and midtown and had a feeling of former glory with an impressive art deco lobby. The check in was efficient and we were allocated a room (1014) to the front of the hotel on the 10th floor. The room was adequate with two queen sized beds and a small en-suite. Unfortunately the sound proofing from the street noise, was very poor due to ill fitting window frames. This, coupled with a dated air conditioning system, meant that sleep was disturbed and unsatisfying. Check out was again efficient but was surprised to see extra charges of $30/day for 'extras' that would be expected to be included in the stated price i.e. Wifi; and fitness room (never knew existed). Overall, my feeling is that this hotel is misclassified as 4 star and has surcharges that should be included in the booking rate.",3,Ciaran S,June 2019
292,Disappointed ,"The hotel is ideally located in Times square and practical for a first time visit in New York. However im so disappointed that I had to pay am additional 25usd per day even though we had pre paid our four night stay, apparently the additional charges are for the "" free wifi ""and general upkeep of facilities. I mean why call it fre wifi if people have to pay for it. I would certainly not return to the hotel.",1,Morakane M,July 2019
293,Great location small rooms,"Great location for a first time visit, Queen room was clean but very small. Bathroom was very small as well but clean. We stayed 3 days. Friendly staff and great service loved our NYC trip! Never felt unsafe was near time square and boardwalk.",4,Barbara G,May 2019
294,Work and Pleasure,"Hotel just finished construction and the 27th floor was all new rooms, we went 4 other and all had good rooms as well, the hotel was close to everything downtown, so we walked every where , never needing a taxi or uber.",5,Enrique G,October 2018
295,Not brilliant,"My wife & I booked to stay here for my 60th birthday in May. I was just hoping for something nice. Initially the outside was a little underwhelming. Through the revolving doors into a foyer that transports you back to the decant Art Deco days of the 30s when it was opened and a very easy check in. There is a reception area here that hosts a ""Happy Hour"" twice week that's worth poking your nose in as a guest. There are staff ""On guard"" by the lifts to make sure only guests go up to the rooms, quick show of your room card is all that's needed. The lifts are swift and wonderfully maintained in their original design. Our disappointment  came when we opened the room door. The room was poky and small, looked like it was a single room with a double bed and not many points. The carpet and the wallpaper had seen better days. The bathroom was atrocious, the enamel had lifted in the bath and ruptured near the plug hole so as you moved while having a shower it squelched, it was extremely small and the wood and paint chipped in many places with dull lighting. Storage was pitiful and a pointless cupboard behind the door that you could barely hang about 4 or 5 items in.In short I would never return to this hotel and would only recommend it to someone I don't like to get my own back on them...",3,jmcguire559,May 2019
296,Good Central hotel,"Located just off Times Square, the Edison is an older hotel that has been revamped to bring it up to current day standards. Twin rooms are  large,compared with other older New York hotels. It seems there is a room upgrade program in progress as several rooms on the 12th floor were being made over.Extremely busy at all times, however the staff are excellent & very efficient.My only criticism is noise levels. Lower floors on 47th street side suffer from outside traffic noise. There is also a large skip housed in a recess to the left of the hotel on 47th street that gets emptied at 5 am.Internal noise can also be a problem. Numerous school parties use this hotel, where a whole floor could be taken over by kids. Thankfully a call to security will resolve any noisy hyper teengers issues promptly.All in all a good hotel. Try and get a room high up on the 46th street side to avoid any noise problems.",4,Kev G,July 2019
297,Great location but a bit rundown,"This hotel is in a great location.  Only 2 blocks to Times Square.  Staff were all very accommodating.  The biggest problem is the rooms on the street side are very noisy.  The bathrooms are VERY small and need to be updated badly.  The rest of the room was clean.  We had spotty housekeeping over the weekend.  Forgot to leave water and enough towels.  The weekdays were fine.  Overall, great value for NYC.",3,Sheryl J,June 2019
298,Great place,This place is a great location if you want be right in the middle of Times Square!! My sister and I stayed there Sunday night after seeing Pretty Woman!! Tommy took our bags the first day and recommended the best places to eat! Staff at front desk needs to be a little friendlier but everyone else was fabulous!,5,Coviello,July 2019
299,Fabulous!,I have been staying at this hotel whenever I'm in NYC for more than 30 years. You will not find staff more committed to their customers. Most of the front of house employees have been with the hotel for many years and each time we meet it is like a wonderful homecoming!,5,Kim Holdridge,June 2019
300,Classy,"Amazing stayWent to NYC for a weekend getaway and decided to splurge. This was our second stay at Edison and it didn't disappoint. We thoroughly enjoyed the Edison experience. The staff was attentive, engaged and completely focused on providing exceptional service. Especially housekeeping and Danny OBrien and his security staff. Danny was a pleasure to meet great Person and really makes you feel safe. The room was well-appointed and clean. We met friends for drinks at the rum house, the services was great, and the setting was perfect for drinks and conversation. Breakfast the next morning in Friedman's was excellent food was delicious, however service slow . Our budget doesn't permit this kind of indulgence all the time, but spending extra really did provide an exceptional experience.",5,Nickhender87,June 2019
301,Beautiful old hotel in Manhattan's theater district,"We enjoyed our 6-night stay in this beautifully restored, full-service hotel, very close to Times Square. Beds were nicely firm, internet was reliable and the elevators (6 of them!) were fantastic. Lots of restaurants and coffee shops nearby. Also several subway lines. A great place to stay in the heart of Manhattan's theater district.",5,Fastenyourbelt,June 2019
302,Helpful & friendly staff,We didn’t love the proximity to Times Square as it was very busy the time we were there making getting back to the hotel a chore...but the hotel itself is ok. The pros: helpful friendly staff particularly Lenora and Shirley and a few others that I didn’t get names of. The cons: the original room we were given was not sound proof at all and the blackout shades were not adequate so resting was not possible. The bed & pillows could also be better. Once we changed rooms the last two nights were a big improvement.,3,MarthaStewardess,July 2019
303,Dated with hidden charges & unhelpful staff. ,"Overall good location right on Times Square - handy for metro and sight seeing bus stops with lots to do.The rooms are dated, once a grand hotel it is in dire need of an update to the rooms - very old and loud air conditioning units that work sporadically. Poor view from the back. Staff were unhelpful and short whenever we asked for assistance. Desk staff who checked us in was rude when we queried the tax - tried to charge us $115 rather than the $80 stated on our booking. This supposedly covers the Wi-fi (which was slow at best), 2 small bottles of water per day in the room and “hotel entertainment”.Also beware of the charge for leaving bags in storage for the day you leave. It’ll cost you $1 per bag then you can watch as the staff pocket the cash - strange behaviour.Don’t even consider trying to return to your bag to get anything out/put anything in as they’ll try to charge you again!! Such a shame that our experience was soured.Would look elsewhere for accommodation.",2,Charlotte S,June 2019
304,We LOVED it!,"Location is awesome! You can come in & out from doors on 46th & 47th, that made things much easier during our stay.However, facility is quite old...you’ll see funky things around. Therefore, if you are seeking for the perfection, probably not this hotel. Since we traveled with my parents, husband, and our children, we had 2 rooms - 1 was signature junior suite...and that room was nice. And housekeeping kept our rooms always nice & clean with fresh linens. Plenty amenities, comfortable pillows...we enjoyed our stay.Oh, and breakfast at in-hotel restaurant Friedmans were very good.Staffs were friendly and eager to help us...hotel was dated but had lots of characters...in best location...overall, we fully enjoyed our stay!",5,AMH,June 2019
305,Nasty...yet convenient,"This hotel was at the perfect location for my family and I to see Hamilton at the Richard Rodgers Theater.  It was directly across the street which was super convenient.  The hotel front desk staff are also very polite and outgoing.  There are several food options on the premises that were also quite good (we had breakfast and dinner there).  NOW LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE ROOM....This was the nastiest, most unkempt, dusty room I've ever been in.  If I could've checked in elsewhere I would have but I was stuck!  First off, the room smelled.  Not sure what the smell was, I just know that all of us in the room immediately turned up our noses as soon as we entered.  The bathroom was tiny and the tub (see picture) reminded me of something from an old farmhouse.  We researched the hotel and saw that it was erected in 1931.  The tub has been there since then, I promise you.  I just couldn't wait to get back home to shower.  I would've felt dirtier in the shower than I did out.The toilet had one of those public restroom flushes that you use your feet to flush.  There was caked up dust around the baseboards and exposed wires.  Luckily no one was injured by them in my party but if you have small children, beware.  My son needed a toothbrush in the a.m. so he attempted to call and there was a constant busy signal for over an hour.  He went to the lobby to ask for one and they told him to go buy one from the gift shop (which has a $10 minimum purchase to obtain).  Once he came back to the room empty handed, we had to seek out a housekeeper who did in fact get us one for free.  They really tried to play with us!  I'll never go back.",1,Thegahdis,June 2019
306,Great location,"Great location. Right on Times Square. Convenient to theaters, within walking distance of many attractions of the city. Close to subway. Many restaurants  in the area. The hotel itself is very Art Deco. Had a very nice happy hour in the lobby 2 days a week. The room was very nice and clean. The beds were comfortable. The bathroom was adequate but could use some work. The staff were all very nice and helpful. Their security for guests screenings to elevator use is a welcome benefit.",4,CarolG,June 2019
307,Great Hotel in a good location,"Just returned from a 5 night stay. We had emailed the hotel reservations team a couple of days before with some general questions and received a prompt detailed response from Favi A which was really helpful.Check-in was good and we were met with smiles and greetings from all staff.Our room (1626) was great. We had asked for a higher room away from noise and our request was kindly granted. Two queen beds, closet with safe, ironing board and dressing gowns. Housekeeper was lovely and our room spotless every day. Fresh bottles of water provided daily too.Location was perfect, a doorstep away from Times Square but away from the noise. Easy walk to a number of restaurants each evening, walking distance to the Empire State building, Macy's, Central Park, Top of the Rock etc plus a subway minutes away which takes you directly to Whitehall station for the Statue of Liberty.We would definitely recommend this hotel and look forward to returning to it again in the near future. Thank you to all staff for a pleasant and enjoyable stay.",5,TheWebbs12,June 2019
308,City Visit,"This hotel is right at Times Square so not far to walk. Reception looks really great and staff are friendly. Rooms are a bit dated with cracked paint on doors, dirty bathroom ceiling and noisy A/C unit in room. But rooms are clean and well kept by cleaning staff 😃 No hotel bar which was disappointing since my daughter is only 18 we couldn’t go elsewhere.",3,Amazeballs111,June 2019
309,Art Deco Treasure,"The property is really something!  Everywhere you see a Little Deco jewel!  The lobby is stunning but way too busy to actually enjoy.  I was surprised at the bustle that never abated.  Our room was adequate.  The access to the “terrace” was actually up a few steps out the window!  The sofa bed made the bathroom hard to access.  For 4 ladies it was quite crowded, but doable.",4,Dottie78737,March 2019
310,"Clean, comfortable and quiet.",Staff was extremely friendly. Quick check in and auto check out available. Rooms were very small as expected but very clean and nicely appointed. They have security going into the elevators so only guests can access the floors beyond the lobby (nice).We were greeted by a gentleman at check in line and during the short wait answered a lot of questions I am sure he has repeated 1000 times but was enthusiastic as if it was the first time asked. We had contact several other times during our 5 day stay and was helpful and interested in our situation each time. While trying to print our boarding passes we had a problem getting them-called down to front desk and within a couple minutes he was there and solved another problem. His name is Aaron Kirshtein  (asked for his card). Hotel Edison he is a great asset to your fabulous team. Employees like Aaron make this an amazing hotel experience!!!!!,5,megsgram,June 2019
311,Holiday,"Very disappointed, booked a twin room and a double for 4 days at the start of our holiday. On arrival hotel looked ok, on leaving the elevator on the 5th floor we were met by an unpleasant smell, from there is went down hill. The double room was no larger than 9ft x 12. Small dated en-suite and tiny closet with no light. Twin room whilst bigger was similarly dated. The worst was still to come in the form of the air conditioning which took made the room feel like a blast freezer fro warm to freezing when it kicked in every 15 mins add to that it was incredibly loud. The upshot was 4 sleep interrupted nights. As I say very disappointed and looking forward to getting to a hotel we can actually sleep in.",1,Mike G,June 2019
312,"Location, location, location ","Just a few steps to Times Square. Just a couple of blocks to Hells Kitchen, and some very reasonably priced restaurants. Totally surrounded by Broadway theatres. Hop on hop off buses and the subway all around the corner.  The location is second to none. The price was very reasonable. Our room was a little old, with a very small bathroom, but was clean and had a comfortable king size bed, so what more could you want.I’d definitely stay there again, if I’m lucky enough to return to this amazing city",4,juzcruizin,June 2019

316,The old reliable,"This hotel is Broadway in New York, giving visitors  the “best seats in the house”, so to speak. In the middle of Times Square, walking distance to shows, restaurants, museums, easy subway access. There is no better place to walk than NYC, take advantage of the architecture & energy. I have stayed here since the 80s, I have tried another hotel, but the service and convenience did not compare.",5,Coco0110,June 2019
317,Tony was very helpful,We stayed for 5 nights had a problem at Checkout and Tony was wonderful helpful and very nice.  Thank you Tony. Hop on Hop off bus located down the street made it very convenient to get around.  Everyone working in the Hotel were very kind,5,Readyin15,June 2019
318,Sketchy front desk behavior - credit cards reissued after visit,"The Edison was our choice of hotels over the past 40 years for family visits; memorable for great employees, service, and their restaurant.  Returned June 23rd and fortunately I had a print copy of my reservation through my airline rewards card.  Employee Z... argued about the existence of our reservation. Then shifted to rewards credit card = no good and requested second credit card which was also no good, requiring her to step away with both cards and the front desk supr. T was able with some effort to split charges on both cards....for unknown reasons to our fraud depts of issuers this morning. . Let's just say, I returned home to have reissue of both cards that left my presence. Sadly, the 10th floor queen was in disrepair and my husband received a nasty ? unknown/insect bite when he removed his shoes and walked across the carpet. It was a great relief to check out having only booked a two night stay. Sadly, its time has passed.",1,MJW,June 2019
319,Family Vacation,"We love this hotel. This was our second time staying here. Great location and perfect for families.I love that you cannot access the elevator without showing your room key.If you can swing the cost, the terrace room is wonderful. Standing above all the hustle and bustle and just people watching is nice. We are a family of 5, so the terrace suite was absolutely perfection. Everyone had their own space and an extra bathroom. It was a win win situation.You cannot ask for a better location, just around the corner off of times square, and the shortest of walks to theatre's. We will be back!",5,Jill D,June 2019
320,Suzanne Asher,"Very nice hotel,nice room with good view of time square,friendly service, great price. Had a problem with tickets we purchased at concierge desk though which created a hassle when trying to visit Empire St building. The hotel credited me right away once I explained situation.",5,Suzie A,June 2019
321,EXCELLENT HOTEL! but Not Victor,"Good : • We arrived early and room was not ready which we perfectly understood, Zenofina ( i hopefully spell her name correctly) , She was amazing! she welcomed us with a smile and helped on our check in process she even told us “ happy anniversary” when we checked in which make us feel really good. we left the hotel to explore and hours later I got a text message saying my room was ready at 1 pm instead of 3 om which I think is a nice thing they do. • This young bell man from Mexico took care of our luggage while we were gone, they charge 1 dollar per piece which I think is ok. • There is also one guy that ask for your room key in order to use the elevator which being in time square is a nice touch, one day I forgot my room key and they nicely explained that to me, they gave me the option to get one at the front desk which i did, • The view from our room floor 19 was spectacular!, the sunset looked amazing and we loved it, we read the hotel was old but I did not see it that way at all, actually it was really good place to stayed at. • We had a welcome amenity due our anniversary from the relation guest manager which we loved! it was a great touch he did for us and we really enjoyed! Thank you!!! • check out and check in were really easy and fast, • rooms are clean and renovated, halls were also clean and even carpet is old, its well maintained, We took the shuttle transportation to JFK Airport for $30 usd per person which I think it was fair enough, shuttle was on time concierge helped working that out. NEGATIVE The only negative issue we had was when we came back to the resort (around 8 pm ) so tired ( first day , first time in New York, i am sure you can imagine) we stopped by the bell man stand since any of the three guys there did not approach and ask if we need anything, I had to tell them we needed help even they saw us with a bunch of shopping bags in our hands, i am ok, but my wife ? I told Victor we needed help getting our luggage , he asked for our tickets in a rude way and he came we had a missing bag, we told him about it and he answered with negative attitude  “ you gave me four tickets I give you for pieces of luggage, simple as that” , it was not what he said because makes sense it was the way he said it , one of the bags had a second small bag connected and for some reason they removed it that was why we did not have the other ticket he was asking for, after he answered that I told him  that is not the way to answer or treat your guest, he kept being rude and said,” if you don’t like it that is my manager”  and he pointed the front desk,- what kind of employee at a hotel answered that? I understand this is not a 5 stars hotel and its NYC but I didn’t think it was appropriate. Juan saw what was going on and he stopped by and took all our luggage and bags and he offered taking everything to our room, he gave us a full room orientation, he even explained a couple important things about the partial view to the water we had and he finish with “ is there anything else I can assist you with” which it was good. My wife and I work in the hotel industry, both in five starts hotels and we love watching all the details and how other hotels work, We did enjoy our stay with you overall.",4,Juan Pablo,June 2019
322,Birthday ,"Amazing hotel with all the staff very helpful and the room was brilliant, we were upgraded as my partner explained it was my 30th so they were nice enough to make it special, New York itself was the best city I have ever experienced and this hotel is ideal for Times Square, Rockefeller centre and Maddison Square Garden.",5,Iain & Lauren,February 2019
323,"New York Trip for Theater, could not have picked a better place!","Great hotel right by theater district. Big 2 Queen size beds for my daughter and mother in law. Old hotel, but very clean, friendly, and great staff. The price is great to me as I can't beat the location.  Will definitely go back again.Received very friends/kind services from manager Danny and front desk staff Skirt.Also, 2 great restaurants in hotel: Friedman's and Bond 45. We ate at both places and had excellent food and services too.",5,Wika G,June 2019
324,"Great Location, Clean hotel","This hotel is the perfect location for attending a play at Richard Rogers Theater. literally steps from the theater.     The hotel is very clean, the staff is friendly, the restaurants serve great food!    Our bed could have been better, it was worn and on the soft side.  But otherwise a great stay, we would stay again if going to NYC.",4,Crissy T,June 2019
325,"Great location, great old hotel, rooms are run down and service so so","We stayed here for 6 nights as part of our family trip to New York. Had booked a family room. When we arrived late at night the room was not ready and we were offered 2 sigle rooms instead. Check in took forever and I had a feeling they had messed up our reservaion. Those 2 rooms was small, and really in need of renovation. Next day we were moved to the family room which was better but still worn. Sleep quailty is as expected when you are that close to Time Square. So that is ok. Service was slow and arrogant in the reception. We had very brown and smelly water one day and they could not care less when I reported it at reception. Location is great as you are close to everything. Price I consider fair considering prime location on manhattan. I would stay here again, but i would keep my expectations a bit lower than the pictures justifies",3,Bjoern A,April 2019
326,I❤️NY & the Hotel Edison is so close to the time square 🗽,"+  Frist night was very loud and we found out that the window was damaged.  After we changed rooms the next day it was much quieter and we did sleep well on the good beds.  The staff is very friendly from the guys who take care of the baggage storage, over the housekeeping, the security until the reception.  We know the hotel is not new but i renovation of the bathrooms would be a grate gain for the hotel.  Over all we are happy with our decision to stay at the Edision Hotel. The location is superb just some steps away form time square. The internet is free!!!- Bathroom is old. A refurbishment of the bathrooms would be nice the floors and the rooms would need this too.  Quality of the internet access could be better.",4,Ralph,June 2019
327,Summer in NYC,"We cannot recommend Hotel Edison highly enough. It was the second time we stayed there and everything was great. The staff is very nice and the room was clean with comfortable beds. The hotel is literally steps from Times Square. If you plan on staying in New York City, you can't do better than the Hotel Edison.",5,JoAnn,June 2019
328,NYC Trip 2019,"Stayed 5 nights at Edison Hotel, check in and check out was flawless, staff were very friendly. We were given one of the hotels recently renovated rooms on 20th Floor, which we found extremely comfortable and very clean. The room had a coffee machine with the added bonus of decaf coffee which delighted my fellow traveller.  Location of hotel is steps away from Times Square where you can get on the hop on bus tours.  Metro stations are close by which can get you down town or uptown also access to the E line that gives you the airport link to JFK.  There is an amazing pizza place at the end of the block called Carve served great slices.  If I ever return to NYC I would stay at the Edison until then I would definitely recommend it to anyone going.",5,Karen C,June 2019
329,"Expensive & old,","We were told when checking in the room on the 14th floor was one of the better rooms, you're kidding, old, wall paper hanging off the walls, tile missing cracked replaced by odd tiles. Bath room no bigger that a cruise ship bathroom. You call that one of the better rooms, I would hate to see the other rooms. This room was a DUMP. It was raised with a receptionist but fell on deaf ears and saying they were booked out.The location of this hotel is great 10/10, but that's as far as it goes. I was reading other reviews which indicated the rooms were being renovated and almost complete. I can assure you are room had not been renovated.I supposed it could have been worse, we have been informed that rooms in the Hudson Hotel were even smaller and damaged than our room.Also this resort fee or whatever they want to call it, is a con just to make more revenue and you get nothing by paying it.

331,Holiday ,This hotel is in the center of everything. If its shopping or a show or eating out everything is at your door step. The staff are friendly and helpful. The room we had was small but had everything we needed. There is a bar and restaurant with lovely food and astomphere. Any tickets for shows or tours can be got at the hotel and taxis just outside the door. Great place to stay.,5,carol4670,June 2019
332,Great Location in Times Square,"I've stayed here before and it has always been a pleasure.  The location, right in the midst of the theater district and across the street from TKTS is fantastic.  Staff were always super helpful and friendly.  Will definitely stay there again.",5,jwtsbsf,June 2019
333,"Great Hotel but ,,,,","Just back from a long weekend staying at this Hotel.  Cannot fault the location - first class - right at Times Square - handy for everything.  The room size was good for New York in comparison to other hotels we have stayed in so that was a plus.  Comfortable bed and ample bathroom supplies also.   We had difficulty connecting to wi-fi although we followed the exact instructions so if you go and this happens alert front desk immediately.   We had intermittent service in the room which was very frustrating, especially when planning the day ahead.The only major issue we had was the Concierge service.  Upon arrival I enquired about tickets for The Book of Mormon.  I asked about ticket availability but the guy behind the desk seemed more focused on telling me the average price was $200 dollars.  I got it the first time he said it and subsequently the second.  Perhaps it was how I presented myself after a 7 hour flight that made him think the ticket price was out of my reach - but I walked away dismayed at his lack of action in checking availability for my husband and I .    I did advise I had previously seen it in London but thought it would be a great show for my husband to see.   If I misunderstood the first or second time, it was crystal clear to me on the third offering that tickets averaged $200.    On another occasion I asked one of the three girls eating chunks of chocolate behind the desk where the Patagonia store was.  I understood it was in Soho somewhere, but referring to earlier difficulty with wi-fi, I could not locate it myself.   Not sure if she misheard me, but she asked if I needed my nails done .... , a little puzzled I looked at my freshly manicured nails and said No.  I was asking where the Patagonia store was.  Again, there was some frantic typing into Google but alas nothing.   We left the hotel, found wi-fi connection at the nearby Starbucks, located the store and were at the front door within 20 minutes.We appreciate that some hotel staff move from location to location in order to garner experience, but it is frustrating to deal with so many people unfamiliar with the area.    On our last stay in New York, the Concierge in another hotel was a local and she was absolutely brilliant - knew all the best places to eat - both cheap and a little more extravagant - where to shop for the best value and some hidden treasures that only someone from New York City would know about.Would I recommend people to stay at Hotel Edison - absolutely - cannot be faulted on location or bedroom facilities - but do your research before you go so you don't waste time at the Concierge desk,",4,BeeDee,June 2019
334,Fraudulent card payment,"Be careful people, check your bank cards for fraudulent card payments!We stayed 5 nights in may and gave a credit card to be pre authorised for the resort fees. Upon check out, we chose to pay the fees using another card. When we got home, we found that the payments have been debited from both cards. There have been a number of emails back and forth with the accounts team and they still say that only one payment has been debited, yet as per our banks, both have been taken. As we cant get the issue resolved with the hotel directly, we have to treat it as a fraudulent transaction with our bank. Be wary people.",1,Guide594777,May 2019
335,Great hotel !,"I stead here In July 2018 for 5 nights and I absolutely loved it! The hotel is so clean and so staff friendly.  There was one man in particular who was so nice to me and my family he was a cleaner! We had a cake for a birthday one night in the lobby and he insisted to clean it witch he didn’t have to.  The rooms wore basic but kept very clean.  The security, reception staff and cleaning staff wore so friendly and always made us feel welcome in the hotel!☺️, this hotel is perfect if your looking for somewhere to stay in Times Square as it is central to a lot of things in Times Square.  I would recommend this hotel to family’s looking to travel to New York!!",4,Katelynscully15,July 2018
336,The City That Never Sleeps,"Being a fan of the Hotel Edison, I made a return trip back to NYC and stayed at the hotel for a weekend in March.Like always the staff is great and super helpful!  When I arrived at the hotel before the scheduled check-in, I checked my bags and headed to some meetings.  Surprisingly, I received a courtesy phone call from the front desk to let me know that my room was ready earlier than anticipated and ready for check-in.I can't stress enough how great Rommel Gopez and his team (De'Marcus, Christine, and Robbi) are to work with.  Throughout my whole stay they checked in with me to make sure that everything was ok, along with sending me some extra goodies to my room for me to snack on while working.   The location doesn't get any better as you step outside right into the heart of Times Square.  Gotta love the Rum House that is connected to the hotel as well.  Great spot to meet some friends for drinks without even having to leave the building.  Must order the Dark and Stormy as it is a classic!The room, like always was clean and comfortable and served its purpose for the weekend as I was constantly in and out.  With all the hotels to stay at in NYC, the Hotel Edison will always be my first choice when visiting NYC not only because of the location, but the staff makes you feel like family!",5,Adam C,March 2019
337,Best Place to stay in Midtown,"I have stayed with the Hotel Edison for years.  My most recent trip was nothing short of  phenomenal. From entering the hotel to checkout, each person made the effort to make the experience special. I want to thank Scott Getes and Danny O’Brien for going out of their way to make everything perfect.  I will continue to come back and encourage all to stay at this amazing property.",5,Jergler,June 2019
338,Kind staff but had issues,"This is the lowest rating I think I’ve given any business. The Edison is a cool old Art Deco hotel and the staff were generally very helpful and nice Taryn looked after us when we had a very late check in, she was fabulous. The cleaning staff were friendly and the hotel was generous when we asked for extra tea in our room. Unfortunately our first room had a diabolical air conditioning unit with a noise level that would be illegal in New Zealand. It was either roaring or quiet and stiflingly hot. We complained several times and staff sent an engineer who said he would come back but didn’t. We complained more vigorously and more engineers came and informed us it’s just the way the air con was in that room and that we needed a room with a different system. By then it was too late to change (again, now it’s four nights) but Tex organised a room change for the following day. We were exhausted by the time we got our new room but it was so much quieter. We also had an issue here as they were doing some work on our floor which they decided to start at 7:00 am each morning. We had no notice from staff and no apology for the noise. It was four or five days of drilling hammering and big skip bins clanking past our room. Our final issue was that I could not connect to the wifi after the third day. I followed the instructions on the login page and emailed the company in charge (after trying a number of things myself). They replied telling me to try something I’d already done and didn’t reply again until the next day. I managed to get back in for a few days then lost the connection again. I emailed them again and was quite cross and they replied wanting me to call so they could manually connect me but I was out in the city until late. I let the front desk know we were not happy with the issues we had during our 14 day stay, which was a significant sum of money for us and the manager wiped the extra $25 daily ‘facilities fee’ which came to about $400. This was less than 10%  of our total fee. The manager was not very apologetic at all and with the wifi issue claimed I should have come to see the front desk (it doesn’t say that on the wifi page - it has a very clear process to follow).I wouldn’t stay here again and I dont recommend you do, despite most of the staff being charming and the location being good for theatres. A little front footing and a proactive approach by management would have changed my rating. Give people breakfast vouchers and a note about the noise if you plan to work at 7:00am. Take fees off when you change our room that was unfit for guests and apologise for our stay not being great, don’t make us feel rude for complaining!  We also had other friends who stayed for a week because we were there. We tipped the staff, gave them NZ chocolate and were well mannered guests. A good discount and a sincere apology would have made the difference. If you check my other reviews you’ll see I dont complain often. Disappointed.",2,marianne a,June 2019
339,"Edison, iin the heart of Times Square","This was our 2nd stay at the Edison and we'll be back.

In-house amenities (tour guide kiosk, restaurants) were handy.",5,Arlon C,June 2019
340,New York city,It’s an older hotel but clean and a great location.  The staff is excellent and very helpful.  Their food recommendations were exceptional.  We enjoyed our visit and would highly recommend it. It is in walking distance to many theaters and attractions.,4,sharonv1960,June 2019
341,Excellent stay,"Great hotel! Beds are very comfortable. Perfect location in Times Square! Definitely recommend, in the middle of all the broadway shows. Delicious breakfast on site.  Very clean rooms and lobby. Great customer Service. We really enjoyed it. Will be back in September.",5,knw4ever,June 2019
342,"It's all about ""location"" at the Edison, but our experience in this older hotel was very good","Staying at the Edison involves compromises. You're choosing between stunningly perfect location vs. room size and amenities.This classic Art Deco building has been beautifully preserved and restored, especially in its public spaces (including the lobby, the restaurant and even the elevators). The hotel's two entrances (on 47th and 46th streets) are literally across the street from some of Broadway's most famous theaters. Staying at the Edison means easily walking just steps to many of the theater district's world-renowned landmarks, including Times Square and Broadway itself. Two subway stations are just a couple of blocks away. Penn Station is an easy 13-block walk; the Port Authority bus station is even closer. You're just a few blocks from The New York Times, and literally half-a-block from the Times Square area of Broadway, with all its neon and animated screens. The hotel is adjacent to the much ritzier ""W"" Hotel, and across the street from the Marriott, so you're in excellent company. The hotel is beautifully maintained and clean. And everyone on its staff whom we encountered was friendly, helpful and as efficient as a busy Broadway hotel could manage. (The front desk just doesn't have enough staff to handle the crush of check-ins around 3pm and check-outs around noon, so the staff sets up a cordoned waiting line for the next available desk staffer. The highly-promoted electronic ""instant checkout"" wasn't working during our stay.)But it's an old hotel, opened in 1931, when the standard for bathrooms in New York was miniscule. In our bathroom, it was not possible to swing open the door while someone was using either the sink or the toilet. Our bathroom had been brushed up a bit; new floor tile, caulk and paint, and new fixtures, but no new wall tile. A six-foot guest should not expect to be able to see their hair in the low-mounted mirror over the small sink. Water pressure in the shower was fine, and there was plenty of hot water.Our ""Classic"" room was very clean, including new carpeting and good window coverings for privacy and light-blocking. We had a corner room, so there were two windows, but no ""views."" (That wasn't a big deal for us; we didn't choose the Edison for ""rooms-with-a-view."") Our bed was excellent; very firm and completely clean. Furniture was scarce (no dresser, a small, but adequate desk). The nice rolling desk chair was the only seating in our room (not that there was much space to roll the chair anywhere). Our room had a good, spacious closet and a room safe. Our room was not a place to ""relax and enjoy;"" it was a functional space allowing easy access to everything New York has to offer. Our housekeeper was terrific and super friendly; we appreciated that!Our 14th floor room was pretty quiet, likely because it was on a high floor and because it faced south rather than north toward busy 47th street. New York City is a VERY busy place, at all hours of the day and night. Expect to hear emergency sirens and car horns through the night. We heard them, but were not bothered. We could hear nothing from adjacent rooms.The hotel offers other ""classes"" of rooms, including ""Signature."" If room size is important, consider upgrading to one of those.Because the hotel is so busy, and because of its heart-of-the-city location, guests are required to show their room keys to enter the elevator lobby; that gave us a feeling of good security.We enjoyed the adjacent restaurant, Friedman's Cafe, for breakfast, where service was excellent and the food delicious and well presented. The dining room itself, surely once-upon-a-time and elegant room, has had its Art Deco features nicely preserved (check out the ventilation grates and the ornate vertical columns). Omelets were $18, oatmeal $11, granola with fruit $12 and juice $8. Delicious pastrami hash was $20.Wifi is not free, and for much of our visit, it was sporadic. Because of a complicated pay-wall, it's clumsy to ""register"" more than one device (2 guest phones and a laptop, for instance) in a single room.The Edison is one of those places guests will want to be alert to the pricing system. The advertised room price does not include a mandatory $25 per night ""facility fee,"" which supposedly pays for the hotel gym few guests use and for wifi, which would be OK if it worked well. (Maybe in the future, hot water will be classified as an extra ""facility"" charge so they can lower their advertised room rate?) Likewise, New York taxes are rampant. Guests even are charged a tax on the ""facility fee!""Paying almost $400 per night at the Edison, for a non-luxury room, seems excessive... until you remember that you're paying for location, not for amenities.",4,Projournalist,June 2019
343,Disappointed so far,"1 night in with 2nd coming up and so far definitely would not recommend staying here. Weren’t placed in Room we booked. Called and they said it was unavailable but agreed to knock off facility fees ($114 for 4 night stay) plus free breakfast each morning. Fair enough and appreciated!  AC not working properly in bedroom. Visited front desk 3 times with one no show, one visit that supposedly fixed but not so. 3rd visit met with 2 men from facilities stating its working properly even though it will not cool lower than 74 at night. They turned to walk out despite my pleas and I essentially had to threaten to call the GM to get them to agree to do more work. Also noteworthy is that this is one of an alarming number of hotels that locks temp in guest rooms at unreasonable levels to save money. When I’m paying $400+ per night, I deserve to have my room at 70 degrees if I wish. It should also not take 3 requests to get help. Also noteworthy is that each of these hardworking people have been tipped for their efforts. Dignity and respect are important no matter the problems.",2,William J,June 2019
344,Birthday treat,"Had a fab time in the wonderful NYC, stayed in Hotel Edison great location at Times Sq , clean and pleasant staff.we arrived early and room wasn't ready , no problem to leave baggage while we went out and about👏🏽",4,Charmaine R,June 2019
345,Great Location and Ambience!,"This hotel is a beautiful, Art Deco-style hotel, located near Times Square for easy access to areas around the city. In spite of being on Times Square, it was quiet enough to sleep in, and the room was big by NY standards. The staff were so friendly and helpful; we had an issue with our AC while there, and a tech came to our room late at night to fix it, then checked on us the following day. We found out about this hotel through a deal on Expedia; will definitely consider it for future visits!",5,Kristen S,June 2019
346,Hotel edison,I took my daughter for a 3 day sightseeing visit for her birthday. Hotel Edison was our home base. It is in the perfect location for visiting all the wonderful sites. The staff was professional and courteous. The attendant in the gift shop was particularly sweet. Concierge was outstanding. Room clean and very comfortable.,5,Teri M,June 2019
347,New york,"We loved our 3 day stay at the Edison as we have in the past as well.  The staff are all friendly from the staff checking us in to the elevator control and luggage control area, to the maids on our floor.  Everyone excels at their job and make us all feel welcome.  Our room was clean and well stocked and perfect for our needs.The location of the Edison is perfect for live jazz, the theatres,  and restaurants.  We could walk and subway everywhere we wanted to go.  I would recommend this hotel to new and seasoned New York vacationers!",5,gjparker2016,June 2019
348,Short stay Eddison NY,"Just returned from the Eddison hotel in NY, ideally situated to times square, all shows within very close walking distance.we also walked to Empire state building and found Macy's department store on way, also walked to Blooming dales store just out side Central Park plus Dylan candy store (kids would love this) and also got bus from center to out of town shopping center,(weather very bad so ticked a few indoor boxes) My main interest was to Coney Island on tube (warriors movie) weather this day sun shine and blue skies, weekend and Puerto Rican festival so broadwalk packed but lots of room on beach. Back to hotel having refurbishment we had old style room so not the best fray to carpet edges old chips to many years of paint but not end of world beds very comfy, in general it's good but some may put bad reviews for this. All in all really enjoyed it biggest regret not going for long enough.",4,Shaun M,June 2019
349,Our favorite place for 38 years,"We've been bringing people to New York from Illinois for 38 years to see Broadway shows and explore the city, and we always stay at the Edison. The location is perfect (front door on 47th Street by Times Square and back door on 46th), the rooms are fine (some are tiny, but you're not in New York to spend a lot of time in your room), and there has been a lot of renovation (great job with the elevators in particular - they're so fast now). But the real asset is their staff!  The Bellmen and Bell Captains are the best anywhere. Right off the bat, I think of the incredible Kevin, Tommy, and Larry, but they're all great. And most of them have been working there for years and years. When I arrive and they greet me, it's like coming home -- and I know that anything related to our luggage will be perfect (plus, I just know that they're there for me). Great security staff as well - helpful and friendly. It's a huge and busy hotel - prepare for some delays at check-in, but I wouldn't stay anywhere else.",5,Pete G,June 2019
350,The Edison is situated in a fantastic location for Times Square and the Theatre district.,"The hotel is a wonderful place, with staff that go the extra mile to make your stay a fantastic experience. This was our first time in New York and things could go horribly wrong if you choose the wrong hotel. Please be assured you could choose the Edison with confidence that your stay will be a good one.",5,Steve the brush,June 2019
351,Perfect location!!,"This was my second stay at Hotel Edison and an even better experience than the first. The larger dresser space was greatly appreciated, meaning we did not have to live out of our suitcases.  Check in went quickly.  When we arrived, our room did not have a coffee maker.  House keeping promised we would have one as soon as one was available...it was there for our second morning!!  Extra towels promptly sent.  Very friendly and helpful staff from doormen to housekeeping and everyone in between!! Location is perfect...close to theaters, tkts booth, food and wine on 9th or 10th, cabs outside door, subway a few short blocks away!!",5,Linda D,June 2019
352,Fabulous experience!,"Our family of 5 stayed at Hotel Edison as part of our East Coast vacation (we're from Nebraska), and we couldn't have asked for a better experience.  I found the valet service quite convenient and the people at the door were very friendly and helpful. Our room was clean and comfortable for our family, even though we have two teenagers.  I expected more noise, since the hotel is so near Times Square, but we had three quiet nights' sleep.  No hassle check-in/check-out. The location was incredibly convenient for tourists wanting to see Manhattan.  Definitely would stay here again!",5,Matthew H,May 2019
353,Great location!,"Everything about this hotel made our visit to NY more memorable, from the time we checked in to the time we left it was great ! Even though it is an extremely busy giving it’s  at Times Square they once inside you were made to feel relaxed to staff that checked your room card before you entered the lifts made you feel safe , the rooms are fine although the bathroom is somewhat small it didn’t matter as you aren’t in there much, we did hear  some street noise but as we were extremely tired once we got in every night it didn’t stop us from sleeping! The restaurant was nice but a little pricey,Thanks for the pleasant stay!!",4,Amala_92,May 2019
354,This is a lovely hotel!,"This was my first stay at a hotel in the theatre district. The history of this place is well preserved. The hotel and my room (double beds) were very clean. All of the staff that I encountered were friendly and accommodating. I'm usually a big name hotel person, and we stayed here as part of a group. I would stay here again if I were booking on my own. Thank you again, Hotel Edison staff, for giving me such a pleasant experience.",4,Vannatraveler,June 2019
355,Wonderful Personel!,"I stayed at Hotel Edison the last week of May. From the moment I checked in, I was provided with a worm welcome and introduced with everything the hotel had to offer. The staff, from front desk to security and all the way to room service, were very polite and helpful with any questions. Great location and good people. Thank you!",5,Shpend E.,May 2019
356,Perfect location!!,"We stayed at a Hotel Edison the first week of June this year. We were pleasantly surprised with the hotel as I did not know what to expect.  The lobby was nice and inviting. We arrived there very early in the morning and they held our bags for us all day. Check in was super easy!  All the staff that we met through out our visit were very polite and always greeted you with a smile. The rooms were small which was to be expected and the bathroom tiny. However, they were very clean and the beds were super comfy. The rooms might have been a little bit older with a little paint chipping here and there but nothing that would make me not stay there again.  I didn’t plan on spending much time in the room as this location was so close to everything. We took advantage of the Rum House downstairs and had breakfast every day at Crave on the corner.  Next time we visit New York I will definitely look into staying at this hotel again.",5,clarkyOhio,June 2019
357,"Great Stay, Great Service","Stayed at the Edison Hotel on the recommendation of a friend. Boy was he right. Incredible location, a half block from Broadway in the heart of Time Square. At the end of my stay, I forgot my i-pad in my room. I was sure it was lost but figured I give the hotel a call to see if the staff may have turned it in. As great employees do the i-pad was turned over to security personnel. I dealt with Jonathan Bracero, Assistant Security Director. What a pleasure. Mr Bracero made it a breeze to get my i-pad back. Two days later FedEx delivered to my home. Thank you",5,Mike C.,June 2019
358,"Great Location, Clean Rooms, Lacking in Perks","The location alone makes this hotel a great place to stay. The room was very clean and felt very safe. We were impressed by how quiet the room was considering it is in the middle of Times Square. The hotel provides you with bottled water which was also nice. The price was right compared to many other hotels in that part of the city. My only complaint would be the lack of a mini fridge, microwave and coffee maker. I knew this ahead of time and did bring my own mini coffee maker. However, we wasted a lot of expensive food from New York restaurants that we were not able to store due to the lack of fridge and microwave. The staff we did talk to were nice and helpful. We did not try the hotel restaurants. There is a little grocery store called ""The Food Emporium"" that is only a couple blocks away that we used for groceries. You can walk anywhere in Times Square from this location. It is also fairly close to Hell's Kitchen which has many good restaurants. Overall, I recommend this hotel for location, cleanliness and security, but don't expect too many extras!",4,nattydread35,June 2019
359,Great Stay!,"We stayed at Hotel Edison June 5th-9th. Times Square is within feet of the front door of the hotel. If you want to be where the action is, this is the place to stay. After reading many reviews before our stay, we decided that we would upgrade to a signature room, as those are the rooms that have already been remodeled. We are glad we did. The room, although a tad small, was perfect. It was nicely updated and we did not have a single complaint about anything of it. I have read many reviews about people complaining about the size of the rooms, the views, etc. If you are coming to NYC to sit in your room the whole time, then I feel sorry for you. We were up and out of our room by 9:00am every day to explore and did not return until the evening, so all we needed was a place to crash, and this was perfect. Being on the 15th floor, we did not hear much from the street, however Friday and Saturday night were a bit more noisy. That is not anything the hotel can be faulted for. The only reason I may shy away from staying here again is Times Square itself. Being from a small town in the midwest, Times Square can get overwhelming and having to deal with it for 4 days got to be a bit much. Again, not the hotel's fault at all. But if you wan to be in the middle of the action, this is where you need to be!",4,Christine G,June 2019
360,"location, staff and weather couldn't be better!","I had the opportunity to attend an event at the Edison Ballroom.  Beautiful space in a great, location.  I also stayed at the Edison Hotel.  Great staff, security was copious at checking room keys and insuring the right people were entering and leaving the hotel. Two on-site restaurants serve fresh moderately priced food and a great lobby to wait before and after check-out. Color scheme isn't my thing and some of the furnishing are signs of age but clean and comfortable all the way around!  Good deal for the cost.",4,Ann J,June 2019
361,Great location,"This hotel is in a great location literally at time square 47th street /8th ave . The hotel has a great entrance / lobby and all the staff were very helpful. We were on the 16th floor and had two rooms next door to each other both with super king size beds which were huge compared to our king size in uk. The beds and pillows were really comfy and our teenage kids shared the king size bed , both felt like they were in two single beds as the king size was so large! Rooms were clean and spacious enough with huge flat screen tv, robes, good hairdryer and collection of bathroom amenities, tea coffee making facilities and free bottles of water replaced every day! There is slight street noise but that's inevitable  due to where the hotel is plus you can't get away from cars and emergency services beeping there horns .... I found ear plugs were sufficient for first night then got use to it or just so tired from sightseeing just didn't hear it anymore!! There is a bar and cafe but we never used this facility as we grabbed breakfast on the go from the many food bars outside.  Also check out is at 12 noon but if you have a later flight you can leave your luggage at the baggage hold for €1 per bag or case. Be aware there is a resort tax on top of your hotel price which is charges on departure of approx $28 per room per night (not that I agree with this) most city hotels charge this now which is for the hotel facilities that you may or may not use ie concierge , gym , reception  , luggage etc ( abit of a con as this should be included in your hotel price you pay but unfortunately you can't get out of it !)Recommendations : look at the ticket office behind the stairs in time square for cheaper show tickets, there's also plenty of hop on hop off bus that you can go on which saves your legs as well as gives you all the history and info of New York , however the subway is just as easy you can get a metro card for $1 and top it up depending how often you use it we shared it as a family and top it up as and when we wanted to use it, each fare is approx $2.70 each per ride so you can add $11, $33 €45 or more depending how many are using it. However we bought a NYC explorer pass before we left the uk that saved use lots of money and big cues. Should you visit Statue of Liberty you must buy the tickets to go inside the statue before you get to the island which you can buy at the ferry port before you leave (something we wasn't aware of, but didn't spoil our trip as there's a museum there as well as ear phones to hear the history of the place).Time square is very busy especially at weekends with acts and shows however be aware of people trying to sell cd's and pictures as they come across very chatty asking where you've come from and what's your name next thing they've wrote your name on the cd and signed it then ask for a donation and get quite cross if you don't buy it my son got jizzed Twice... Plus everyone wants to be tipped in America something use uk people aren't that use to unless you get exceptional service ...... Most say at least 10% -15% to taxi drivers, waitresses, bus services and guides in fact it seems anyone that gives you a service!!!!Taxi service to hotel- we used go -link from the airport which we pre booked a shared taxi for £70 for 4 passengers each way inc taxes which is still slightly cheaper than a yellow cab .  Great service on the return but on arrival we landed on a bank holiday and they were very busy and had to wait an hour and a half which wasn't good as told we'd only have to wait 15 minIn all we had a great stay in NYC and at the Edison hotel Thankyou!",4,Ian K,May 2019
362,Good,"Excellent location. The service was warm, nice and kind. We got a back room on the 14th floor - the room was very nice, quite, with a new bathroom.We made a mistake and arrived on a wrong date, they were nice to help us with it.",4,Limor L,May 2019
363,Great location,"This is the second time I have stayed at the Edison. It is in a wonderful area to attend theatres, restaurants & shopping. It’s also right near Times Square if you want to be near that action. The hotel is clean & the rooms are fairly sizeable by NYC standards. The staff are helpful. The Edison is a lovely Art Deco type of place & in the lobby there is so much of interest on the walls.",5,Amanda,June 2019
364,4 night stay at Edison Hotel,Really enjoyed our stay at the Edison hotel that is ideally placed right next to Times Square. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout our stay.

365,Family and Friends Graduation Celebration,"I had 6 rooms booked at this hotel in May for a magnificent graduation celebration.  The hotel's location was perfect, rooms were clean and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their stay.  Overall, the hotel staff was very pleasant, helpful and accommodating, some much more than others.  The staff standouts, who particularly should be recognized are Laura Zebejian (Asst. Front Office Mgr), Eric Boamah (Front Office Mgr), Jonathan Lopez who was extremely helpful & patient, Skirt (guest services) and Roland :)  Thank you all for a beautiful stay.",5,VLee_12,May 2019
366,GREAT LOCATION,"We loved our stay at The Edison and that was mainly due to the kind hearted and helpful staff member Zhermina. She upgraded us to a lovely room on the 22nd floor. She was very helpful and always had a smile. If we wanted to know anything we asked her. She answered everything and went out of her way to help us. We travelled around America for one month and we got engaged at Graceland. I was telling Zhermina about our travels and I mentioned the engagement. When we came back from an outing we found  a lovely gift with a congrats card attached. It was sooo special because that was our first present and card as all our family and friends were back home. This hotel is in a super location, it is very close to Times Square, Broadway shows, subway trains and restaurants. We will highly recommend this hotel after all Zhermina did to make this a special stay. Zhermina  is the BEST and she made our holiday soooo special.",5,Brian w,May 2019

368,Very disappointed,"The location to Times Square is excellent the hotel itself was a total let down I paid over £1700 for 7 nights in a classic room with 2 queen beds, the photo online that l thought l was booking looked beautiful, well, what we got given was a room with wallpaper peeling off the wall carpets coming away from the skirting, mould under the window and a bath that looked as though it was an original installation, 2 double beds. I complained and was moved to another room also sub-standard compared to what they advertise on their website, this room had a wardrobe that had four coat hangers and would hold no more than that. So for a week we lived out of a suitcase. And they advertise a roof Terrace that they no longer have.I’m not sure  l would stay here again and l really don’t think companies should be allowed to advertise rooms that they appear not to have",2,Judi  K,May 2019
369,Ideal central hotel ,Perfect location for seeing the main New York tourist spots. Our double queen room was spacious and comfortable. The staff were friendly and having to show your key to get to the lifts gave the reassurance of security.,5,AngelAdvisor,June 2019
370,"Amazing location, service polite but slow ","My partner and I stayed as well as my parents (2 separate rooms). The rooms themselves were quite small but still had all the basic amenities needed for a comfortable stay. The linen and towels were lovely and  clean and we were delighted with bottled water daily, which was welcomed during the warm New York days. The hotel does have a gym and bar however we didn’t use these facilities. We also enjoyed the close proximity to Times Square!! I was a little disappointed that even though we booked months in advance our rooms were not close together (same floor but opposite ends of the building, took ages to walk back and forth) and I wasn’t very happy with the check in process, we were left standing in line for 45 mins waiting to receive a key, we had already paid and formalized check in paperwork etc several hours prior. Service from reception was polite but very slow. I would stay here again for the prime location!",4,Kms121,May 2019
371,Midtown’s Best One Night Stay,"Within a five minute walk to any Broadway theater or to Rockefeller Plaza and attached to a bar and a restaurant, you can’t ask for a more convenient place to stay in Midtown Manhattan.

I come into town and you can't get much closer than this! 3 theatres in the same block as the Edison! I love the customer care that I receive. I can arrive early and they store my luggage for me and when I'm ready to return I'm welcomed in. A nice surprise was Edison Hour which happens on Tuesday and Friday. Snacks, drinks, and music! It doesn't get much better than this!",5,Toni J,June 2019
375,5 Day break in New York Oct 2018,"We were very pleased with the Hotel Edison, the location was ideal just off Times Square central to everything we needed.

We found all the staff very pleasant and couldn’t do enough for you we would definitely stay there again.",4,MammaWales,October 2018
376,Best experience at Hotel Edison,"The location is very well located, it is 50 meters from times square and you can walk 5 min to the nearest metro station (50th street or 42nd street). They welcomed us in a kind way since the first moment we arrived. They were so friendly and if you had some problem, they tried to help us so fast. About the room, we booked an executive room with two separated beds, it was really renovated and clean. If you have money and want really enjoy new york and manhattan, I would like to recommend to stay at this wonderful hotel. Nice staff :)CheersEnzo",5,Enzo Torella,May 2019
377,Great location!,My family and I stayed here over holiday weekend. We had a suite which was well appointed and clean. There is little to no street noise or for that matter adjoining room noise. Well insulated! The staff was friendly and very helpful. Great location in Times Square. Would definitely stay here again.,4,Jenny H,May 2019
378,Do not stay here!,"We are currently staying here for my dad’s “bucket list trip to New York”. We booked this hotel months in advance and I contacted the concierge a few times to coordinate some things due to traveling with my elderly father who requires a mobility scooter to get around. I received no help from the concierge regarding any of my requests except for a return email inquiring that we currently did not book an ADA room to accommodate my father. I requested an ADA room so we wouldn’t have an issue and never heard back again regarding this. We travel quite frequently and this has never been a problem fitting a mobility scooter in a standard room so I didn’t think it would be a big deal. I contacted the hotel on 4 different occasions regarding questions, etc and they were unable to help with me with anything. The hotel itself has charm and is full of history but our room is ridiculous!  The a/c doesn’t work, we had to ask for a coffee maker and the bathroom is actually SMALLER than a cruise ship bathroom!  I understand it’s New York and things are expensive but for what we are paying in total ($1950 for 5 nights) this is atrocious. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS HOTEL!!!!",1,Jennifer J,June 2019
379,Lost and Found,I recently stayed at Hotel Edison for a weekend in early June.  Hotel staff were always extremely friendly and answered any questions we had quickly and with a smile.  I was even helped out recovering an item left behind when I returned home!  Can’t thank them enough for that!!  The hotel is right in Times Square and extremely close to all the great shows the Theatre District offers.  Really enjoyed our weekend!,5,Dave O,June 2019
380,Avoid!! ,"Average location.... and that’s about it for the positives. The hotel is overpriced, and whatever you do, stay away from the ‘classic rooms’. They are not just dated, but they are dirty with peeling wallpaper and old stained carpets. We moved twice and both rooms were as bad as each other including dents in the doors and poorly maintained bathrooms. Not what I would expect for over $250 a night! Staff refused to move us to the renovated rooms after saying it was full (then found a renovated room some how.....which was habitable). There are much nicer hotels in better areas. Nice to visit Times Square but wouldn’t stay there again, and would certainly avoid this hotel.",1,Tim Z,May 2019
381,My Favorite Manhattan Hotel,"This is my 4th stay at Hotel Edison. Each time I have a great check-in experience.  The rooms are super clean, quiet and comfortable. I love having breakfast at Friedmans next to the lobby. The location is amazing for buying Broadway tickets.  You are right in Times Square! You can walk to Hell's Kitchen, Central Park, Madison Square Garden, Penn Station! You won't be disappointed! I would recommend you book directly from their website as they often have promotions to save you money.",5,Jesse S,June 2019
382,Hotel of nightmares,"I kinda knew from the moment i made my booking i was not going to have a good experience. My booking was on bookings.com partial payment - but the hotel took the entire payment, even the taxes etc that normally get charged at the hotel. I insisted confirmation i wouldnt get charged a single cent extra when i arrive, never got it and they re- charged me the taxes and extra fees when i arrived. Also didnt have the room i booked 4 months in advance. Gave me a smaller room in return. Then had to wait 5 hours to checkin even though i asked for early checkin as i was flying in from South Africa on a 30 hour flight. I would never recommend this hotel to anybody.",1,Tina S,December 2018

385,Not what I expected,Just back from a 5 night trip to New York. Stayed at this hotel and definitely won’t be back. The pros Great location...On arrival we were allocated a room on the 11th floor. We booked a junior suite and after reading the reviews were quite happy..... not for long! The door to the room looked like it could be blown open with a puff of air! On entering the room my heart sank not before the smell took my breath away! I looked around and thought this is what I am paying 300 dollars a night for!! It was dark dirty and smelly. Clearly this room has not been upgraded since the 70s. We went to reception to complain to be told that’s what we booked... I booked through hotels.com and the pictures showed the renovated rooms. Eventually they agreed to put us in a different room on the 7th floor but the reception staff clearly didn’t care too much for the complaining. It was much the same as the first room except it didn’t smell. First night we get a call to say someone was here to see us could they send them up.. having read previous reviews I knew this was a scam and they come up and rob you... didn’t believe it was true but here it was. The room was cleaned daily however when something is that old it’s like putting a bow on a unpolished turd!! There is dirt so ingrained it would never be moved. We wouldn’t even put our clothes in the drawers!! Just because there’s a burst couch in the room doesn’t make it a suite... in all honesty I wouldn’t of put a dog in it. As we arrived on a Saturday night all hotels were fully booked. We seriously considered leaving. If you are going to stay here you really need to lower your standards and expectations. While the location was fantastic the hotel really needs to redo their rooms. In my eyes you can’t charge 300 dollars a night for what we got. I’ve stayed in far nicer hotels for much less. I would avoid this hotel at all costs.,1,Lynsey M,May 2019
386,Convenient to everything,"I loved this hotel. It was convenient to everything we wanted to visit.  Price was right!  Restaurant was great.  I would recommend Hotel Edison.  Rooms are somewhat small, but we're not there to stay in our rooms. Just to sleep.",5,Angela D,February 2019
387,The Big Apple,We stayed in the wonderful hotel close to everything!! It’s older but clean and very convenient. The staff is polite and always making you feel welcome. (especially Robbie ).

Can certainly recommend this hotel.",5,Colin S,May 2019
391,Love Hotel Edison!,"I visit New York City several times a year and always stay at the Hotel Edison. Honestly, some of the staff have become like family/friends to my family. We have enjoyed getting to know them over the years. This past trip, my husband and I had the privilege to meet Mr. Geres, Mr. Lindsay, and Mr. O’Brien. Their standard of hospitality and customer service is beyond excellent. We love the accommodations, the restaurants, and the location. But what we love most about the Hotel Edison is the wonderful people that we see each time we visit. See you all soon!",5,Kelly Day,May 2019
392,Great location; Time Square 50m away,"We were totally happy with our choice to stay here. Referred by a friend who has been to NYC a few times we trusted their choice and was not disappointed. We had a Signature King which was comfortable; the small walk in robe was a bonus. Be mindful all NYC hotel rooms are small, so keep an open mind. The bed and pillows were extremely comfortable. The hotel is literally 50m from Time Square and right in the heart of Broadway, so theatres are at your feet. At check in check that you have a renovated room; some I understand are still being renovated.",4,SandyWR,May 2019
393,Worst customer service and room quality - great location ,"This hotel is in THE best location close to theatres, Times Square etc BUT the staff hardly acknowledged you and the room had iron prints on the carpet plus peeling paint and wallpaper. I may have been able to get past all this until I needed to have a fridge for my daily injection medication  and I got a fridge but when I asked to put the cooling medibricks into a freezer ready to fly it was just No! No ideas, no options and yet they cater?????  I arrive at my next hotel who had absolutely no problem storing my medibricks in their freezer- thank you.",1,ROckCr,June 2019
394,Only good thing is the location,"Well talk about some creative marketing with the pictures taken for the website. While the location is great (half a block from the TKTS booth in Times Square), the standard of the room means that you’ll try and stay out of it as much as possible.The first thing I noticed was that the glass in my window was broken and had only been repaired with sticky tape. Sections of paint off the roof, cupboard rail rusted, carpet coming away from the wall and the bathroom door’s paint had also cracked off making it look like someone had tried to claw their way out. Generally very old and dilapidated.   Hair dryer didn’t work and the standard of housekeeping varied. All of these things are obviously understandable given the age of the property but not ok, when the hotel’s website gives a very different renovated impression.Also as a solo traveller, not having a chain on the door or something similar was disconcerting.I know I’m going to get one of the standard cut and paste responses from the hotel but it’s not really good enough when these aren’t unfortunate isolated bad luck incidents that occurred but rather a general state of the property.",1,Sightsee580921,June 2019
395,Annual Trip to Manhattan Inlcudes the Hotel Edison,"My husband and I always try to stay at the Hotel Edison.  The staff are consistently helpful no matter what our questions may be about.  We really appreciate the 24/7 security service by the elevators for hotel guests.  The hotel is good food and the service is fast.  We greatly appreciate the location as we love taking in multiple shows.  We have already booked another stay in August.  Bob C - Seattle, WA",5,Bob Chapman,May 2019
396,"Good place, great guest service agent","We stay here for 5 nights to visit NY. The room was for us enough and good as well. For only sleeping and a bit of relaxing big enough. At the booking in was something going wrong. We already paid our package but every day there was a deposit on my creditcard. By the checkout the guest agent named Tex made everything on the right way. No problems and no double paying. Thank for your help Tex , you are a proffesional.Fam Veldt Netherlands",3,Veldt R,May 2019
397,"Great location, safety place to stay but need some improvements ","The location of this hotel is perfect if you want to enjoy Times Square area and Broadway. Safety place to stay as they have security guards checking the people who enter to the hotel. You will be required to to show your room key at the elevators entrance to get into your room.I reserved a Signature Room for two nights. The room was Ok but did not fill my expectations according what I saw in photos prior my arrival and in terms of cleanliness! The bathroom was clean;  but I can’t said the same about the room’s carpet! I felt too much dust coming from the carpet!Regarding the cost to stay at this hotel, I think is a little expensive for what you get on it.  Not sure if I will consider this hotel again for a future stay in New York but it doesn’t mean that I do not recommend this hotel.",3,ing_hiro,May 2019
398,Dirty hotel with unpleasant staff,"Good points are..... good location but nothing else!Now the bad points....rooms are extremely noisy with staff and guests banging/slamming doors at all hours of night and morning. Rooms were dirty and need updated. We got moved once due to our room being unclean and noisy but our other room was sadly the same with stains on the carpet n generally very dirty n not looked after. Cleaners must’ve been very rough as they destroyed iPhone charging cable, electric shaver and one of our suitcases wheels completely snapped off. Wi-fi connection was off and on when you were in the room which thankfully wasn’t long other than to sleep. Staff didn’t care when reported damaged items and just shrugged at us. Would not recommend as there are cheaper and nicer hotels nearby.",1,Jezza_K9,May 2019
399,"Location, location, location","Besides the comforts of the Hotel Edison and it’s place near Times Square, the Art Deco lobby and the classically  styled rooms make it such a comfortable stay. This is my fourth year staying there and they must have some superb training for their staff because everyone is helpful, enthusiastic and pleasant. If you’re going to theater it’s an ideal location with great restaurants within walking distance. It has become my favorite.",5,catherine s,May 2019
400,Great place & great guest service agent,"The room was big, clean and very nice. But the best part was Tex, a Guest Service Agent, who helped us with every question we had and every thing that could possibly go wrong with our stay and the packages that arrived for us here from Amazon. He was also nice and spoke our native language. Thank you for everything, Tex! We are a very grateful for everything.",5,amandabenatti01,May 2019

As I keep limited $ on for pay AT hotel bookings.Asked hotel via email why they were charging card and my reasons for booking how I did. There response 1 line with ""we have the right to take 1 night"".Next email was to advise that their commitment to customer service was outstanding (yes, I was being sarcastic) and reluctantly card for payment provided.New email today ""Booking cancelled""If this is how you treat people prior to paying, then heavens help the service once your locked in.",1,Travel Queen,May 2019

405,"Awesome Visit to the Edison Hotel, NYC.","The Edison Hotel in NYC is your place if you like great location, comfortable, clean accommodations, wonderful staff that go.out of their way to make your stay better. This hotel is literally 30 steps to Times Square.  Surrounded by Broadway's best, and On Restaurant row.From the guys at the front door to greet you, to the always smiling ladies who clean your room, it's the real deal at the Edison.  Scott, the General Manager is doing a fine job here.  I've stayed at NYC very expensive chains, but for the last decade or so, have returned time after time to the Edison for their great value, and wonderful team.  Keep up the great work Edison, your efforts are making the difference.   See you very soon!",5,Clinton P,May 2019
406,Great hotel- Tex is brilliant!,"From the moment we arrived, we were made to feel welcome by Tex. After a long flight it was great to receive a friendly welcome. We had an issue with our room, and Tex took care of it with no fuss- great customer service.The hotel itself is ideally placed for visiting all of Manhattan. The rooms are clean- essential! We would recommend this to anyone looking for a central location.",5,The G’s,May 2019
407,Always Top Notch,"I love staying at the Edison Hotel.  For the tourist, just off Times Square,  it's conveniently located in the center of everything.  It's only a few blocks away from the majority of subway trains that can get you almost anywhere in NYC.  On the hotel grounds are two exquisite restaurants for casual or finer dining, plus, you're just one block from ""Restaurant Row"" in Hell's Kitchen, giving you a wide choice of dining experiences.  You're just a few blocks of Central Park, Rockefeller Center, St. Patrick's Cathedral, 5th Avenue shopping.  The rooms at the Edison are very comfortable, clean and quiet.  I love my stays at The Edison.",5,Kevin P,May 2019
408,Honest review,"Dated, mold spores on the walls, ceiling and door frames, especially in the bathroom. Beds comfortable and firm. Staff are friendly and personable, security staff are excellent and on the ball. The location is ok, right on top of time square so provided you're above 10th floor you can't hear much.it smells like garbige just outside the hotel.  on arrival our room smelt like feet and bleach, we were offered another room, although dated like the last the bathroom had been refurbished except ceiling that mold had been painted over. None of this spoilt our holiday because NY was so awesome so provided you can overlook the disrepair of the hotel and understand you won't spend much time in the room except to wash and sleep it's ok. All the staff are lovely and helpful. It's a 3 star if that.",2,Samantha,May 2019
409,Excellent location Classic hotel,I have stayed at Hotel Edison each time in New York starting in 1986 and at least 6 times in between now and then. I have always enjoyed my stay and hope to return again some day. It feels comfortable and it is nice to return to something that I know and can depend on - great service and such a central location in the city that never sleeps!,5,Heather M,March 2019

411,Close to shows!,"I love the cleanliness of the hotel.  I stayed here for a second time over Memorial Day weekend.  I did not find the front desk people very friendly this stay and our reservation was not correct.  They did replace with requested beds but room was not as big as last stay.  Overall, I would go to Hotel Edison again.",4,Valerie L,May 2019
412,Unimpressed,"BIG disappointment  - I am a regular user on booking.com and I booked this hotel back in October 2018 for our stay in May 2019. We were attending a concert at MSG. The ONLY reason I booked this hotel was so the 4 little girls I was taking to the concert could have a terrace. Upon arrival I was told ALL terraces were locked down as they were doing work on their rooftop terrace. OMFG, are you kidding me!!?? I am uncertain WHY the hotel would not have reached out to let me know - I booked 2 rooms, both with terraces. Had I have been notified at least I could've upgraded to the presidential suite. This was a HUGE disappointment as everyone was looking forward to having a terrace in Times Square. What a big let down. And they only reduced each room by $50, which is not the difference for having the terrace. He told us they were also giving us breakfast, but I had that booked with the room anyway!The rooms are small yet comfy - and they are clean",3,ABWTD,May 2019
413,"""...perfect!""","We were only in town for a couple of days, for a wedding. Beautiful hotel, nice room, terrific service (thanks to Juan at the front desk for the great restaurant suggestion [Five Napkins, fantastic hamburgers]. We didn't have tons of time to walk around, so we wound up eating breakfast @ Friedman's, in the hotel, also very nice. The reception was at Bond 45, also in the hotel, also beautiful, incredible, great service, in other words, the optimal New York experience for a stereotypical mid-westerner (Ohioan, actually).",5,Fippin,May 2019
414,Hotel Edison Times Square New York,"My husband and I were on business trip.Had a terrific stay, very clean , friendly staff and central to everything. Most of the time we walked from hotel to a lot of places as traffic can come to a standstill sometimes.Subway is just around corner. Hop on , hop off bus is good but Big Bus tours I found to be a lot better as they give you live talk about what’s in area.Hotel Edison has the Rum bar which plays Jazz , very nice setting for a drink or two. They have two restaurants you can eat at . Or the amount of bars & restaurants around town are awesome and there’s plenty.",5,Spoiltrotten48,May 2019
415,Great location / tired hotel,"If you are looking for location and just somewhere to rest your head (not sleep) then this is the place for you.  You really can't beat the location, literally steps away from Times Square, Broadway shows and restaurants.As for the hotel, the front desk could stand to step up their politeness game but all of the other employees we came into contact with were pleasant.  The room was small (but so is every other budget NYC hotel) and clean (most important) but it would be nice to have a small coffee pot, enough towels and wash cloths.  The hallway noise was also pretty predominant...not the hotel's fault but I am only mentioning if this might be a game changer for you.",3,TinaP71688,May 2019
416,Wonderful staff and clean rooms,"The Hotel Edison was perfect for our stay in New York. It is centrally located just steps away from Times Square, and was a great hub for all of our activities around Manhattan. The staff of the property was great to deal with, specifically Marisela, who helped us through an initial issue with our room not being prepared. The security staff by the elevators made me feel welcome and safe every time we enter and exit, so we knew no one who was not a guest could access our floors. The room was spotless every day.",5,DanielleMilln,May 2019
417,Unhelpful reception staff,"On arriving to check in, the man on reception was incredibly rude. He did not give us any information about the hotel amenities, WiFi (which didn’t work first time), the fact the hotel had a gym and restaurant attached or even a map which would have been helpful. All he was interested in was who was going to pay the 100$ deposit. We asked him if our room had a good view and his reply was “I don’t know, your given what we’ve got” The room itself was ok and the beds were comfortable however it was the smallest bathroom I had ever seen - not fit for purpose.The hotel is not sound proof - I barely slept due to the street noise and we were on the 10th floor. I would not stay here again or recommend it.",1,Minnie1702,May 2019
418,Service can be improved,"Our stay at Hotel Edison was decent overall except for a few things. Our room was located on the 15th room, where the wifi signal was really bad even though we were properly connected following the hotel guidelines. Another negative aspect of our stay was the city tour recommended by our hotel. We weren’t told the tour was not going to return to the same location of first pickup, and so my parents, who dont speak English and are of advanced age  were left ALONE about 30 blocks away from the hotel. They really struggle to come back after a full day tour.  It was the hotel’s responsibility to explain this IMPORTANT detail to us about the tour they sold to us but they didn’t mention it. The hotel lady selling the tours wasn’t very informative  and she seemed more interested in selling and getting us off her shoulders than anything else. Overall Hotel Edison could highly improve its service by providing more care for their customers, updating the wifi signal which is a service we paid for and didn’t get it, and being more informative about the tours they sell on their property.",2,Maria,May 2019
419,Great service,"I had a problem with my reservation (my fault) and Juan at the reception desk went above and beyond to help straighten out the mess I created. Really an outstanding young man who really cares. Thanks Juan, you may have saved my vacation!",5,Tk97,May 2019
420,Poor Customer Experience,"Do yourself a favour and stay away from this hotel! The customer service is extremely poor and the rooms are average and noisy.I went downstairs at 2am to ask for a room change. I was told to comeback after 7am for the Manager. After numerous interactions with the front desk I finally had a room change which was only slightly better. This hotel also charges you $28 per day ‘facilities fees’ for facilities you won’t use. We couldn’t even get their basic wi-fi to work. Apart from being in the heart of time square, I have nothing positive to say about Hotel Edison. My customer experience and satisfaction rating would be a 2 out of 10.",2,Tim S,May 2019
421,Can't beat location,"Updated small rooms but can't beat the location. Within steps of Times Square and subway stop (49th st.) to take you anywhere. Clean room, good security, and helpful staff. Will stay again. Complimentary water bottles.",4,Jim C,May 2019
422,Hotel Edison - A Bright Light.,"The Hotel Edison, W 47th Street, is plump in the heart of NYC and a couple of steps away from the glowing lights of Times Square. It is central to most of the Broadway shows, Restaurant Row and world class entertainment. As you leave the semi-quiet environment of the hotel lobby you are thrust into the maddening crowd that promenade the downtown area. Suddenly your heartbeat and blood pressure elevate in response to this rush.Hotel Edison is classy, a historic Art Deco hotel that has suites that have recently been remodelled to include kitchenettes and balconies that overlook NYC. An impressive lobby greets you on entrance, and the reception desk is parallel to the entrance so that it's floor resembles a shiny sidewalk.  The desk, of wood, is massively long and resembles a bar. I didn't know whether to order a drink or register. The basic rooms (Classic) are small, not unusual for NYC, so I upgraded to a Signature Suite with a terrace for a more spacious environment.The stylish decor of the room with a sumptuous bath made the digs a comfortable haven, far from the maddening crowd of NYC, when you needed a break. This room boasted Art Deco furnishings so right in the middle of a soft pallet of decor colours an orange headboard and sofa chairs were throw into the mix. At first I was shocked, but it grew on me (Think: Orange is the new black).One of the highlights of a stay at the Edison is the Edison hour, a reception for the guests with wine and cheese and entertainment. I thoroughly enjoyed this party and the entertainment in the form of a fast-picking guitar player. NYC has a lot of hotels and if you prefer to stay in the middle of NYC mayhem...try Hotel Edison.....A Bright Light.",4,Conny Wylie,May 2019
423,Nice place to visit; Wouldn't mind living there,"We came to New York for a quick 3-day visit, just so we could say that we'd actually been there!    The staff at The Edison were very friendly and helpful and made our stay very enjoyable.  The housekeeping staff were especially nice, always greeting us with a smile and wishing us a good morning.  The location of the hotel itself is very handy, being only about a block from Times Square.  But even being so close to all the action, we didn't find it noisy at all and had no trouble sleeping.  It's not the most modern hotel in town, but so what?  The place is clean and comfortable and just oozes character!! We hope to visit New York again in the near future and will likely stay at The Edison.",5,Greg S,May 2019
424,Best location,"For all the employees and the situation of the hotel, everything was perfect. We were traveling with a baby and they made all the accommodations they could to make the perfect room for us. The new room are beautiful, except some when you can listen your neighbor take a shower. Robby is THE MAN you have to talk at the entrance. He's gonna be the one with all the information and the ""guide"" for you if you wanna know where to go.",5,Marilyne B,May 2019
425,A pleasant visit to NYC,"I was again very pleased with my stay at Hotel Edison. The personnel was cordial and attentive to all my needs. The location is the best.

427,Seven days in New York City - Great location,"This was our first trip to New York from Australia and this lovely Art Deco hotel is extremely well situated. We could walk from either the front or back entrance to Times Square, restaurants and to all of the Broadway Shows. The double decker buses pick up and drop off were within 50 metres walk in either direction. Three staff members that we found extremely helpful were Rommel, Tex and Latoya. We plan to return at some stage in the future and would look to stay here again.",4,alexandra lean,May 2019
428,50 th birthday ,"Stayed here for a week to celebrate my 50th birthday. At first we were given a very small room which was very noisy due to what appeared to be lots of generators outside. We didn’t unpack and went straight to reception and they gave us a much bigger room on the 12th floor, the amenities were good, shampoo, shower gel etc, hairdryer, iron, ironing board, bath and shower. The room was very quiet considering the busy location and the bed was very comfortable. The staff were very professional and I felt safe here, you had to show your room card to security before they would let you use the lift. The rooms were cleaned and bedding and towels changed ever day. It’s a great location for everything bars, restaurants etc. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this lovely hotel and recommend it highly",4,karen d,May 2019
429,My son’s visit to NYC,"It was our Son in Laws birthday and he and our son were traveling to NYC for a long weekend from Colorado. My husband I live in Dubai and wanted to do something as an extra surprise for their birthday adventure. When I first called the hotel I had trouble getting in touch with the concierge. They didn’t answer the phone and sent me to voicemail. Since I was calling from Dubai I felt most likely I wouldn’t get a call back. I called several times to no avail. By the time  De’Marcus was on phone I was a little put out... but really wanted to make a nice welcome for our boys. De’Marcus took over and immediately made me feel like my request was important not only to him personally but the entire Guest Relations of Hotel Edison. I asked for Champagne to be sent to the room and had my credit card ready to pay. He asked if we would like balloons as well. I thought ok, that’s nice. When I tried to pay, De’Marcus insisted that Hotel Edison would gladly take care of everything! Wow! And he didn’t stop there... De’Marcus, Rommel and Jacklyn wrote a note letting Graham and James know we called and they joined us in wishing them the best during their stay in NYC.  Balloons! A Banner! Snacks! And the cutest Teddy Bear!!De’Marcus, Rommel and Jacklyn not only met but exceeded our expectations!! James, our son in law was so surprised! And our son, Graham was thrilled we reached out to make his husband’s day special. You three and the Hotel Edison made such a great impression on all of us. Graham and James loved your personal touches. David and I can’t thank you enough for all you did. As I told you, we live in Dubai and sometimes aren’t able to be with our family on special occasions. So being able to reach out and surprise them isn’t always easy but always worth the effort. Thank you again for making this happen for them and us. I can’t thank you enough for all you did.  You are so kind to follow up with an email and photos of the sweet welcome waiting for their arrival. When I woke up this morning I had glowing messages from Graham and James and how surprised they were.  I’m a happy Momma!I hope your your General Manager knows what outstanding, professional and caring people they have working along with them. David and and I will plan on staying at the Hotel Edison on our next trip to NYC. Warmest regards,Nancy and David Ray",5,NSR622,May 2019
430,Broadway Birthday visit,"My husband and I booked our stay at Hotel Edison because a friend recommended it. Although our room needed updating, it was clean, spacious (rare in NYC), and comfortable. It appears that the entire hotel is in the process of renovation. It’s looking great. What sets this hotel apart is the attentive service of the staff. Everyone is welcoming and helpful. The guest relations team found out it was my birthday and sent surprise treats to my room. The location is perfect for those attending shows in the theater district. We plan to return soon!",5,amckee56,May 2019
431,Hot Edison,"Booked here recently for my first time in NY with some friends. The location is great, so close to everything. The room was fine, just the bathroom was very tiny. The staff was very kind to us our whole stay and security was very polite as well. Overall the stay was fine considering we spent very minimal time in the Hotel anyway. The best thing about the hotel was on our last day we met Robert who was an employee there. He was the best!!! He was so polite, informative and helped a ton! I would stay here again. I am giving this 4 stars because of some inconvenience that happened as we were checking in but was quickly taken care of by the manager.",4,Vanessa Agnello,May 2019

433,Okay,"The position is great, I chose a superior room which was good too, no view at all like advised but I was ok with that, what baffled me is the fact that this hotel is run like they don't know they have hundreds of guests. The lobby is pretty small and they only have 2-3 receptionists on the floor, which makes checking in/out a very slow process due to the super long lines. Y'all charge 250$ a night, you can afford to have more employees to make the service smoother.",4,LauraW,May 2019
434,Good hotel.,"Walking distance from Penn station, Grand central terminal, Central Park and theaters. Metro stations very close too. Windows soundproofing is bad. I recommend earplugs in this hotel. Loud noices from Times Square and air conditioning might disturb your sleep. Otherwise the hotel is clean and well managed.",4,Marko P,May 2019
435,Easy 1st experience,"I stayed here for 3 days and had a pleasant time. The room and hotel met my expectations. It was a super nice location within less than 5 mins walking distance from Broadway and seconds walking distance from Times Square. I felt safe in this hotel and really appreciate that guests have to show their hotel key card in order to access the elevators. The housekeeping was great and friendly. Check in and out super easy. I use hotels as places to just merely sleep, not to lounge and relax so I had no problem with the small size and I totally expected it given that it is NYC. The room was clean and the bathroom nice! I liked the old-time feel and decor. The concierge at the transportation desk was really helpful, nice, and did her job well. I recommend this hotel. If you're worried about getting an unrenovated room I suggest making sure you book a signature room and then email to confirm that the room will be renovated. I did this and they got back to me right away and came through on their word. I'd stay here again. I knew it would cost more to stay at this location but it is the location I wanted so I was satisfied completely. Thanks!",5,laursav,March 2019
436,Revisiting the Edison,"I used to stay here regularly but I decided to try some other places. Last week I was back thanks to a promotion of their signature rooms and I was not disappointed. My room was lovely and had every amenity that I look for in a NYC hotel: comfortable bed with nice linens, a very nice bathroom, a generous closet, bottles of water replenished daily, coffee maker. The Edison staff is excellent in every department. Housekeeping is efficient, the front desk and transportation desk folks are very helpful, and security is visible and effective. The hotel is in a very busy part of Times Square and the lobby is often full of guests arriving and sightseers looking at the historic decorations. The security guards have the elevator bank buttoned up tight. I’m a woman traveling alone and I always feel safe. The restaurant that replaced the old Edison Cafe is great. The fitness center is good. And then there’s the location. Out the front door on 47th or the back door on 46th, you can walk to many of the Broadway theaters in 5 minutes or less. Subways are close by. And the heart of Times Square is a few steps away.The Edison is a gem, a perfect choice if you want the energy of NYC outside your front door and a serene place to relax inside.",5,SuzyQSB,May 2019
437,"Great Room, Great people, Great location!","We arrived early and were going to leave our bags because we had a show to catch, but they had our room ready and the front desk. Marisela was able to get us in and we were able to get settled before our show. The bed was comfortable, the room was plenty big for two of us, and the location of the hotel was perfect. We will be back!",5,RedKitty13,May 2019
438,Perfect Place to Stay,"We cannot say enough positive things about our stay at The Edison Hotel. Met two other couples as part of a college mini reunion.  Staff, cleanliness, responsiveness, Hospitality, decor, location, location, location.  Loved the Tuesday night get together in the lobby.  Made our stay so personal.  Top notch from start to finish.",5,CRKandKAK,May 2019
439,Best Hotel Stay We've Ever Had!!,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Edison, after being dubious about previous reviews at the end of last year we were pleasantly surprised, minus a couple of minor issues (not informed about health and safety waver for terrace door on arrival and an issue with our shower which needed to be reported twice) service was excellent as was the location. The room was smaller than anticipated (Signature Room With Terrence) but was more than adequate although badly needed a dust on arrival. The best thing though was the bed, it was absolutely sublime! I know its a Sealy Posturepedic but if you could tell me the EXACT model I would be forever grateful as I would like to purchase one! Would definitely stay again!!",5,Marc S,April 2019
440,Great hotel,Stayed here last week for 5 nights and we had no problems at all. Hotel does just what you need. We were on the 21st floor our room was small but had everything in that we could possibly need. Rooms cleaned everyday fresh water left which was a nice touch. Friedman’s bar was lovely both food and drink. Hotel is perfect location for Times Square aswell. Can’t think of anything bad to say about this hotel will defo be back and would recommend,5,stacie k,May 2019

442,Great place. Fantastic staff,You can’t beat the location. Rooms are great. Fantastic value. Plus Eric at the front desk bent over backwards to help me. Great guy!!Staff is friendly and helpful.   I’ve stayed there many times and highly recommend the Edison!,5,Neil,May 2019
443,Absolutely the best hotel to stay in!!!!!,Stayed here with my sister 12th- 16th May 2019 last week.Staff were super friendly as soon as we arrived.Hotel room was great.The most comfy beds ever. Second time staying here and was wonderful. Will definitely be back.The rum house was great with really tasty cocktails,5,Karen201330,May 2019
444,Don’t stay here if you drink coffee ,"Edison advertises coffee makers in room. They have 15 coffee makers for 18 floors of rooms. False advertisement is what you get, not an in room coffee maker. Management says says most people go out for coffee!!!!!!!!!So, if you want an in room coffee before you get dressed in the morning, stay somewhere else.",1,Adventure292965,May 2019
445,New York,Hotel in perfect location couldn't get better. Rooms were very clean but could do with updating. Most of the staff were very friendly But have to say the door man his name was Bobby was fantastic helped us so much was so friendly and so accommodating made us feel very welcome.Only downside of hotel was they didn't explain tax charges at all to us. But would recommend hotel.,3,Viola,May 2019
446,Nightmare hotel,Stayed here back in Jan 2019. The room we got from  the start was a disaster. The room was as cold as a morgue. On checking the windows to see were they opened we found that one window was slightly opened and it couldn't be shut tight. Reported this by no one came to fix it. And the heating system was like having an ice making machine in the room. The very loud noises it produced was absolutely wild.. impossible to sleep. On our last night a tiny mouse ran out from under the bed we were horrified to say the least. We were offered a room change didn't take it because we hadn't packed and we were leaving in a few hours. Just not acceptable for 2019 I would  never stay here again..,2,BelfastMaria69,January 2019
447,"Great rooms & location, disappointing customer service","The hotel has an amazing location for exploring on foot, and rooms are very clean and nice, for NYC its also a very affordable option and we had a great stay here until checking-out. The downside to our stay unfortunately occurred at check out and afterwards. We had a pre-paid voucher stating the resort fee price per day, which was very different to what the hotel tried to charge me when leaving. After some confusion and discussion, the supervisor on duty agreed to wave the resort fees for us, and as we were rushing to the airport we thanked him and then left quickly. I noticed a week later the hold on my credit card had cleared and they had in-fact taken the money out, this was almost a month ago now and I have sent 3 emails (all a week apart to give the hotel time to investigate and without seeming annoying to them) and to both email addresses listed on their website, and no one has even bothered to reply to me or any of my emails asking for help. I work in the travel industry and was looking forward to recommending the Edison but my thoughts have now changed.",2,Monica,April 2019
448,"Nice hotel, very central",Best thing about this hotel is it’s location. Just off Times Square!Room was small but clean. Staff where helpful and friendly.  Noise isn’t an issue. We didn’t eat here so cannot comment on the food. I would stay here again.,4,Stephen Q,March 2019
449,What a view!!!!,"My sister in law and i descend on NYC 3-4 times a year...... The Edison has become by far our favourite!!! Just a hop skip and a jump from Time Square, anything Broadway, and the food....oh yes the food....whatever you crave you can find!!!! Our room was on the 21st floor and had what must have been the biggest balcony in the hotel!!!! Amazing!!!! Security, at the elevators and entrances is rock steady, Jonathan (SLO Lopez), was our go to guy!!!! But, Robbi Moss, Guest Services, couldn’t have made our stay any better. Extremely knowledgeable and genuinely friendly. Excellent service from all.....Friedman coffee bar is delicious BTW!!!We will be back!!!Brenda & Marie",5,Brenda Breeze,April 2019
450,Great base for sightseeing,"My wife and I stayed at the Edison from 29 April to 6 May, on our first ever visit to NYC.Now, while I've given 5 stars, there is one negative I'm going to mention first. Our room (2008) was on the 20th floor; even so there was significant noise from traffic & activity in nearby Times Square. Trust me, you'll need earplugs. If I could suggest one improvement, it would be to improve sound insulation.Right, that's the one and only negative.Reception and staff in general - without exception, staff we dealt with were pleasant, helpful and informative. A great team, congratulations all round. A bank of six elevators (or was it eight?) meant you didn't wait long at all. Big plus. Our room was a Signature room with Queen size bed, facing the street, and was both spacious and well-equipped. Extra tea & coffee was available on request and delivered promptly. Full marks here.Facilities - aside from the reception, the room and the Happy Hours, we didn't really make a lot of use of these. No reflection on the hotel, we just were out and about most of the time. Free phone calls available, as is free Wi-Fi (with the Wi-Fi, you need to re-register every 3 days, no big deal, I found). Location - hard to beat. Half a block from Times Square, 5 mins walk from subway stations and several big attractions within 10-15 mins walk. Plus, while the area to the west might not be the most upmarket, it seems pretty safe and if you venture further along 47th Street you'll be rewarded with plenty restaurants, stores etc. that will not break the bank. To sum up, we loved the Edison and would heartily recommend it. Just remember to pack earplugs lol!",5,Ryohei,May 2019
451,"Location, Location","Close to everything. Our room had 2 queen beds. Could use some hooks to hang, stuff, especially wet clothes after being in the rain. Bathroom small but manageable. We had a Kuerig coffee maker. Bottles of water, no fridge. Overall friendly staff.Would recommend this hotel.",4,MillieEdmonton,May 2019
452,Superb stay!,"I got the Royal treatment! The atmosphere, the room, the food(tantalizingly delicious), and the staff were far better than expected! De'Marcus in Guest Relations is the shiznit! Give that man a raise, ya heard!!",5,awalkinpeace,May 2019
453,Times square,Friends from out of town  visiting. We decided on the Edison and we're not disappoint.  Stunning views. Easy location a fine. Seconds away from all the entertainment. Restaurant and bar excellent. I would recommend and I would not hesitate to stay there again.,5,rckct,May 2019
454,Excellent choice,"Location great. You step out of the hotel and you are right next to Times Square. Staff extremely helpful and friendly. Although the hotel is old, it has so much character and very clean.Would recommend staying at this hotel. Value for money.",5,Brian A,May 2019
455,A Stone's Throw From Everything,We arrived at 10.30pm last Friday night to this fantastic hotel. Reception service was very swift as we were in our room within minutes.As said by many before the rooms aren't huge but it wasn't small either and it was perfect for our stay.On walking out of the hotel you look right and see the bright lights of Times Square a staggering 75 yards away. Thos hotel is central to everything. It's simply a perfect base to explore what New York has to offer plus there's an awesome Irish bar (one of many we visited) literally next door.There's theaters at the front and the rear of the hotel and many others within a maximum 10 minute walk.We really couldn't recommend this hotel enough.,5,Welshles,May 2019
456,Perfect Base,We stayed for 7 nights. Found rooms to be spotless. Bathroom was a little tired and needs refurb but was spotless and this would not turn my experience into a negative. Staff were extremely helpful. We booked shoes and Yankee games with Alex in the lobby. Unfortunately the game was cancelled after sitting in the stadium for 2 hours while being told it was only going to be delayed. We tried to get a refund in the stadium on the night but were sent from one box to another with no success. However when we returned to the hotel and spoke to Edel this morning she said she would see what she could do. A couple of hours later Edel informed us she has got us a refund. She has gone personally to The Yankees Stadium and fought for our refund. The stadium is quite a distance away so I feel she has gone above and beyond her job discription and the hotel should be extremely proud to have such an employee.We will definitely be back and cannot recommend the hotel enough for its location and friendly staff,5,marion m,May 2019
457,Above and Beyond for their Guests!,"At the tail end of our long weekend in NYC to celebrate our daughters 13th birthday, she became ill and needed to have emergency surgery. The “big name” hotel we had been staying at did NOTHING to help us and in fact told us we had to be out of our room at noon WHILE OUR CHILD WAS IN SURGERY! We called the Edison who welcomed us, checked us into a wonderful room, and bent over backwards our entire stay to help us, checking in on our daughter when she came home fromThe hospital and doing everything they could to make us comfortable.  Skirt  and Tony at the front desk, tommy at the bell station, and Scott Greeis the GM were absolutely amazing and made us feel like we were at home. Our room was comfortable and spotless clean, the restaurants were fantastic, but most of all the people checking on us every moment to help and make us comfortable will Never be forgotten.  The Edison is the hotel we will stay at every single time we come to NYC fromNow on! Perfectly located and the best, old fashioned customer service! Stay here! It’s awesome!",5,KimberlySANDIEGO,May 2019
458,Perfect Location with Friendly Staff,"I was celebrating my 50th in NYC on my own but felt totally safe and taken care of at the Hotel Edison. The location couldn't have been better to suit my plans! The staff were super welcoming, making sure i had everything I needed, including a bottle of water while I waited 5 minutes to check in. My room was not fancy but was clean and just what I needed. I would go back to stay there tonight if I could!",5,Arlene C,May 2019
459,Underwhelming but well located,"First, the only reason they’re getting two instead of one on their rating is that someone finally reached out to me regarding my poor review on Google.  The room was extremely small and the toilet was located entirely too close to the bathtub. Like it was not possible to sit square on the toilet. Granted, I am not well acquainted with New York hotels, but it felt a bit like sleeping in a closet.  I paid which felt like a fair price initially, but failed to realize that I would be charged an additional $200 at check out due to a daily use fee. I understand that this is pretty common in hotels and I’m sure it was in some fine print that I neglected to read. As far as location goes, it’s excellent. Very close to time square, the shows, and the subway. The hotel did not ruin my vacation but I would not stay there again.  If you’re considering a stay here, I would only stay if a suite is available. In the photo of the room, my back is pressed up against the wall by the door. The room was the size of two queen beds.",2,Johnathan D,May 2019
460,Special New York Weekend,"The moment we arrived we were treated excellently.   The front desk made sure that all our needs were taken care of and had reserved the perfect room for us ahead of our arrival.  It was ready before we were supposed to check in and contacted us while were were out to let us know.The room was very clean and exactly what we needed.   I have stayed at the Plaza Athenee and this staff treated me just as beautifully as they would have.  The location was good for our needs this trip and would stay there again,",5,janetvitolo,May 2019
461,Frequent traveling couple from San Diego CA,"Perfect location for theatre goers. Our theatre was across the street! . Hotel staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience.  Comfortable, clean room, lots of hot water for showering. Twice weekly Happy Hour with delicious appetizers, Very good musical entertainment, free! Stan and Virginia",5,sanfranciscocitygirl,May 2019
462,New York,"Just stayed in the Edison and can say that it was a great stay. The hotel was art-deco style which we all liked, very clean and the rooms were excellent. As it was for our 50th birthday the management had left a goodie bag for each of us which was a lovely touch. Right beside Times Square which was great. Can easily recommend this as a place to stay.",4,Brendan,May 2019
463,Helpful desk staff,"Shirley at the front desk helped make our stay very comfortable, and accommodated an early check-in for us at the last minute. Everyone we encountered at the hotel was really nice, and the renovated room was perfect for our needs.",5,Zach,May 2019
464,Mother's Day Delivery,"I had called Hotel Edison to order Room Service for my mom for Mother's Day. Unfortunately, after many phone calls and being transferred many times I found out that Hotel Edison does not offer room service. Thankfully, after multiple attempts I reached Robbie and Jacqueline in Guest Relations. Robbie was FANTASTIC. He could hear the frustration in my voice after speaking to many individuals at the hotel and he went above and beyond to make both mine and my mom's Mother's Day extra special. Thank you to Robbie and Jacqueline for their kindness and generosity to go above and beyond to make my mom's Mother's Day extra special. Robbie, your thoughtfulness was very much appreciated!",4,Nicole Faster,May 2019
465,Worst service I have ever experienced,"Unfortunately our visit with Edison was very dissapointing. The hotel itself is okay as a three-star in terms of standard, but the location is amazing. The staff however, is the rudest I have ever seen. Staff in the bars were pleasant, but the «service» staff in the desk for booking transfers to the airport, and when asking for the staff to help us hang up the curtain in our room that fell down (!) we had to ask three times in two hours when really wanting to go to bed after a 16 hr flight, and then we were yelled at because «a ticket was already in». It’s a shame because the hotel could easily be a good hotel given the fantastic location, but the staff completely ruins it. I would never EVER stay there again. Shocked!",1,Relax566490,May 2019
466,Miss charlotte routledge,"I have had the best time staying in this hotel. This is my first time visiting New York and the location has been ideal as it is so easy to get to everything I have wanted to see. The hotel is clean with spacious rooms which I was told would be hard to find in New York. The thing that has stood out most for me though is the staff, they are second to none. They can’t do enough to help and are just so friendly. The hotel also have a happy hour on a Friday that I went to with my mum. They offer complimentary food and drinks with a free raffle and amazing singers. We met de’Marcus at this evening who works for the hotel and oh my goodness he is the most fabulous person in New York. I hope everyone that comes to New York gets to meet him because he is sunshine in human form!! He is passionate about his job and wants everyone to have the best time. I watched him go round and talk to all of the guests and it was as if he was friends with everyone and genuinely cares about everyone. Thank you for looking after us and all of your guests. You are the best! Xx",5,Charlie R,May 2019
467,Beautiful Hotel,Great service! Everyone was so sweet and kind! The housekeeper was amazing. We’re from California so our schedule was off by 3 hours in waking up and she respected that. The hotel is literally right next to Times Square and close to everything! Love the view of all the surrounding buildings. Will definitely stay again next time!,5,Jessica Alvarado,May 2019
468,Best thing is Location,The only thing that saves this hotel is its location. Reception staff are gruff and condescending. Rooms are in need of a severe makeover. There is no value for money at this hotel with others close by for similar costs. Would I stay again? No.,2,Global Gazr,May 2019
469,"Great B'way Location, Historic Site, Nice Rooms & Affordable!","Stayed 4 nights with our Osher Life-long Learning group; perfect location for TKTS (1/2-price booth on B'way). Updated, upgraded rooms nicer & more spacious than in past years.  All staff friendly & helpful...we had minor water leakage problem which maintenance took care of promptly & cheerfully. Housekeeping folks do fine job; rooms immaculate (thanks, 'Kwancheewa'). Manager, Kim Confesi, a welcome presence meeting and greeting us guests...always a positive example & good to see!NOTE: Edison popular with international & tour group visitors... so book ahead ;-)",4,wildswanDelaware,May 2019
470,Decent but better options.,"Visited in December for a special birthday of mine. My partner had been advised by numerous people to request a small surprise, which the hotel happily does for many guests, however this was not the case for us which was quite disappointing. Room was on the 6th floor, quite basic and the wallpaper was peeling away from the wall but it was a long day of travel so we didn’t kick up too much of a fuss. Room was adequate for the amount of time we were in it however the free wifi cut us off on day 3/5. Further, the resort fee was not taken from our credit card until approximately 2 weeks after our return from the hotel, which I found quite strange and unnerving. When I check out of a hotel I deem our interaction to be complete and would much have rathered this fee been paid at check in/out rather than during Christmas week.All in all, a central hotel that provides basic rooms for the NY price point. I wouldn’t not recommend the Edison however I am returning to the city next Spring and will be chosing another hotel.",3,Amy,December 2018
471,Great hotel great location,"We travelled as a family of 4, 2 of whom were older teenagers we had a signature family room on the 19th floor it had a closet including iron and ironing board and umbrellas which we missed at first also the family room consists of 2 rooms one with a huge bed and the other with 2 queen beds great for the kids each room has a TV and the bathroom is good and there were always lots of towels and refreshing of the complimentary shampoos and conditioners was a daily occurrence also the room has a safe a fridge and a microwave and a coffee machine. This hotel is just off Times Square so if you want peace and quiet don't stay here because you are in the heart of the madness!! It suited us down to the ground as a perfect base for all of Manhattan's most iconic attractions.It's not cheap but this is NYC and nothing is but we would definitely stay here again the staff were lovely and helpful the hotel is very secure and the beds are very comfortable, what more do you need.",5,Edconmom,May 2019
472,New York trip,"Stayed here as part of family celebrations for various big birthdays, picked this hotel for price and location. A little disappointed when confronted with scaffolding all around the hotel ( this seems to be every hotel in New York at the moment) so missed out on the big arrival, and was told to move down because a coach was trying to park, so didn't even get to alight outside the hotel. At no point during the stay did a doorman ever help us or open a door. Interior a little dated but very functional. We had booked 3 rooms and through various websites knew to request the refurbished rooms on higher floors. I cannot fault our family room, it was absolutely massive. The other 2 rooms booked were however, very small. One guest was ok with this, 1 wasn't, and three room changes later, found a room that was acceptable. In their defence the hotel were fine with finding a room, cannot fault them for that. They even left us a birthday message and small teddy bear as a present.  Concierge helped a bit when asked, saved us a queue and after bartering, saved us some dollars on an attraction. I would recommend to anyone.",5,Rikritches,May 2019
473,Bad experience,"Was there for a 4-night stay as I was attending a conference close by. The room was small and very dated (room641). Super noisy. I woke up every night due to other people just... being hotel guest. Entering their rooms, talking in the hallway etc. It went straight through my door. Also I could hear the bedpost squiking from the room next door. The bathroom... The lights went out when using the hairdryir etc. And this is NOT a cheap hotel even though the overall feeling is that it is",2,Koebenhavn,May 2019
474,Birthday to remember in NYC,"Stayed here for 5 nights to celebrate my 60th birthday first time to USA, loved Hotel Edison, right by Times Square, would certainly stay here again, room lovely and clean, bed very comfortable, food good in the restaurant all made my trip memorable (room was a king junior suite 22 floor)",5,kthlarnl59,May 2019
475,March in New York,"Visited this hotel with my mother in March. After a tiring journey from Wales UK, we arrived to check in not long before midnight, but we were told that there was not a room of our type available for us. We were given the option of having seperate rooms for our first night and then we could either keep them for the remainder of our stay, or check back in the next day and have a twin room which is what we booked in the first place. Feeling exhausted, we agreed to have the seperate rooms but they were a bit outdated and tired looking. They did the job for our first night's stay, but we were given a twin room the next day and it was so much better. Two spacious beds, lovely bathroom with a walk in shower, tea and coffee making facilities, a very clean and pleasant room. It was quiet too, considering we were in the heart of Times Square, we didn't hear any outside noise. Breakfast was very nice, we were given vouchers to use, which was a limited choice and you could also order off the main menu which had much more to offer. Staff were very welcoming and friendly at the Edison and I have already chosen to stay here next year, when I return with a friend. Love New York and I can't wait until I come back for another bite of the Big Apple 🍎",4,Michw1975,March 2019
476,Best NYC hotel by far!!!!!,"We just arrived home from a fabulous stay in NYC. Our stay was especially great thanks to the staff at Hotel Edison. I cannot say enough good things about this hotel. Upon arrival, we met Danny O’Brien—what a host he was!!  If you are ever in town at the Hotel Edison, ask for him. He gave us good local recommendations and really showed us true hospitality!!!!!  We took advantage of all his restaurant recommendations and he did not steer us wrong!!  The rooms are clean and a good size for New York standards. I cannot wait to go back to NYC and you can bet I will stay at Hotel Edison again!",5,Kristie Carnes M,May 2019
477,Turning my frown upside down,"I was having an awful day, and decided to head down to the wine bar in the lobby. It was there that I had the pleasure of meeting a young man named De’Marcus. Despite the fact it was a crazy packed lobby, he took the time to make me feel as if I was the only guest there. He personally found me a seat while helping me carry my plate of snacks & wine; then took the time to ask me how I was doing AND he genuinely cared to hear the answer. I know this may seem small to many, but it brightened my entire day, I truly appreciated his spirit.",5,Erica P,May 2019
478,Short stay,"We stayed for a short 3 night stay in may 2019. The hotel is in a great location, 1minute walk to times square. Staff were very helpful, professional and accommodating, hotel is busy and has a nice welcome feel to it.Plenty of options for breakfast too in hotel! Our room was a bit dated and old, however the bed was really comfortable and clean. The bathroom was also really nice and clean too. We got great value when booking , very basic room but the views were lovely from the room window. I would go back again",4,laura baker,May 2019
479,TOTAL SATIFACTION - PERFECT LOCATION for TIMES SQUARE,THIS FIFTH STAY AT THIS HOTEL WAS EXEMPLARY.....and I would totally recommend the spacious Deluxe Rooms which are of a High Standard.Just Gets BETTER and BETTER.....Free Cocktails and Nibbles were on offer when we visited..... Delicious....!!!!Keep Up The Great Work Team....Nothing was Too Much Trouble....,5,SR Barnsley UK,October 2018
480,Great Hotel - Great location - Great staff - GREAT!,"We loved our stay at the Edison. We had booked on Priceline.com (big mistake) We'll never use that company again!!! But alas, Edison staff we're able to accomadate our needs and make our stay optimum! Love the location. Probably one of the best locations in Times Square and Theatre District.And the Elevators - there are always issues with these at hotels in NYC - but this hotel has a lot of them and they are always moving! No long wait times here!!!We'll stay here again!!!",5,Jerry S,April 2019
481,Great art deco hotel in the heart of Times Square.,"I've been staying here for 20 years.  Nice renovation keeping the old Art Deco charm.  There are good restaurants in the hotel and nearby.  The hotel staff has always been very nice.  Right in the heart of the Theatre district, this hotel offers a good value and provides the opportunity to walk everywhere.",4,Dona R,May 2019
482,Great place in Times Square,"I have been visiting NYC for one weekend each year for the past thee years, and this time we picked the Hotel Edison. The staff is great, the rooms were lovely, clean and quiet!! we enjoyed our stay so much this hotel is the choice for nest year!!!",5,Fran L,April 2019
483,Old and Tired,"Stayed at the Edison from April 23 – 27.  This my third, and, unfortunately, last stay at this hotel.  Have tolerated a lot of inconveniences in the past, but this time, I was just not happy and need not return.  Paid extra for a 10:00 a.m. early check-in, and did not get a room until after 11:00 a.m. (after a red-eye from California).  When we finally got a room, the front desk person (Zenorina) assured me that it was a Signature Queen (renovated) room that I had requested and paid for.  The room was old and tired.   Shower pipe coming off of wall.  Doors old and chipped.  Room small and cramped.  Do not be fooled by the photos on the website. Looks nothing like that at all.  According to photos, supposed to have a walk-in glass shower.  Just a tub with a cloth shower curtain.  I did not raise a fuss, because there was a high school choir competition going on at Carnegie and the doorman said to forget about changing rooms because hotel was sold out.  Other issues:  very close to TKTS booth in Times Square and there was noise coming from there all night (street entertainers).  Rum House bar was poorly staffed, although nearly empty, took about 15 minutes for the server to take our drink order.  Just an overall bad experience.  Would much rather stay at the Hilton Garden Inn around the corner on 8th Ave.  Cheaper and much larger rooms.",3,gilbop,April 2019
484,Recent visit,"Average hotel, lobby area very art deco, but rooms a little tried, there was work being done on upper floors to update rooms ,we were on the 5th floor at the front which was quite noisy through the night. Ideally situated for time square at the end of the block, did miss being able to make a hot drink in the room though.",3,Sheila G,April 2019
485,Not as good as it looks,"Upon arrival at our floor, every room had plastic sheets hanging and the floor was covered in a plastic sheet, large scale building works were being undertaken throughout the whole floor, it looked like our room was the only one not being modernised.  As for the room, I've never seen such an unpleasant pokey little hole in my life, it was grubby, smelled, the wires to the air conditioning unit were frayed and laid across the floor.  It was so small one of us had to lay on the bed to allow the other to move around the room.  We were told no other rooms were available until tomorrow, so we had to put up with this room for our first night.  It was only when we got into bed that we realised there was a large air conditioning unit outside, and we managed a couple of hours sleep that night.  The next day we were offered another room, the new room was once again very small, but cleaner also there was no air conditioning unit outside, so we slept well for our remaining nights.  One final point, whatever you do, is don't forget to take your room card with you.  Mrs P was escorted back to our room by two hefty security guards who made her feel like a criminal.  When I opened the door to her and she was upset, I asked what was going on and the security took a very aggressive stance, this was wholly unnecessary as we didn't pose any threat to them at all.",2,Nigel P,April 2019
486,"Great location, wonderful staff.","Edison is a hotel with a long tradition and excellent location. Now that it's been completely renovated, it's even better. It's located in NW corner of Times Square, in the middle of the theater district and every play is within walking distance. It has a good restaurant and my favorite bar - The Rum House. Wonderful little gem of a bar, with great atmosphere and live music.The best part of this hotel are the staff. From the doorman, to front desk , to concierge - everybody is wonderful. Housekeeping are some of the nicest, professional and most accommodating people, especially the clerk Milena and manage Bisere. These are the people that made my last stay here feel special and are definitely going to make me come back.",5,Robert B,May 2019
487,Hotel Edison Wins Again,This was my 4th visit to the hotel and the attention to detail and guest relations are first class.  The location if absolutely ideal for theatre going.  There are also many great restaurants in the area.  Highly recommended.,5,John S,May 2019
488,Great hotel and lovely staff,"We were there for one of my friends Birthday and staff, specially Robbi Moss, went above and beyond to delivery some amenities I've requested.It's great to still see this energy in hospitality and how people will go the extra mile to make someone's Birthday very special.",5,xavier torne,May 2019
489,Excellent Support from the Hotel Manager - Can't Thank Enough!!,"We want to thank so much to the Hotel Front Office Manager Eric Boamah's excellent service and support for our booking! 5 of our friends came with a tour over 10 people from China and we booked the Edison Hotel for them for 3 nights stay at Edison Hotel; but at the last minute we found out our friends have to make some changes at their stay in NYC due to their flight change back to China from the travel agency. Eric was extremely helpful and went extra mile to accommodate our friend's needs. Can't thank enough! Also want to thank Lindsey Gershberg, the Assistant Front Office Manager, who was very kind to help us as well. Great team at Edison Hotel and we would recommend them and Edison Hotel to everyone!!!",5,traveller@ct,May 2019
490,"Location, location, location ","The location is the major plus point for this hotel, as it is situated right next to Times Square and close to the nearest subway station (about 5 mins walk away). This makes getting too and from different areas and attractions really easy, plus the option to walk is there which we did a lot of. Our hotel room was on the 3rd floor, some negative points: room very small. We actually didn't have any view at all, a part from looking at an air vent and in to other rooms, so we had to keep the blinds shut so we wasn't overlooked, meaning the room was always dark. The room was also quite noisy - constant sirens and honking of horns (but you can't expect to be that close to the action without some noise) and I think the vent which we could see worked 24/7 as there was this constant hum including during the night. So bring ear plugs, luckily both my husband and I had already packed some! The good points: like I said location! The hotel was clean, including the room and bathroom, the bed was very comfortable and the hotel was a great base for exploring and our requirements (we didn't plan the be in the hotel room for long, so as long as it was clean and secure we didn't mind too much).You may wish to ask for a room higher up in the hotel to minimise the noise, or upgrade to get a nicer room. All in all a good stay for what we wanted from visiting New York, which was to explore.",3,LindGo,May 2019
491,"Friendly people, clean atmosphere, clean room - no complaints","Friendly people, clean atmosphere, clean room - no complaints.Staff were flexible and supportive of any requests. Room was small but clean and had the amenities we needed. Wifi was a bit spotty at first but we got it working.",5,Vincent,May 2019
492,The best,"You feel like home, and you are right at the center of the universe - Times Square. Friendly people, a great cafè, gym, nice rooms, who can ask for anything more? So many elevators that you barely wait 30 seconds to go up or down. All perfect.",5,Fulvpi,April 2019
493,Great stay at the Edison!! Thank you Robbi!!,"We had the most amazing stay at The Edison! From the moment we arrived we were impressed with the personal touch guests received at this family-owned hotel. The room was immaculate and the location can’t be beat. But the true gem is guest concierge Robbi. We met him at the weekly Friday night hotel happy hour. As we enjoyed free music, food and drinks - Robbi told us how to “rush” the nearby Broadway shoes to get great deals. We ended up seeing Tootsie, Evan Hansen and Book of Mormon - all for great prices. Thank you Robbi for making us feel like Broadway royalty. We will be back!!!",5,Amy T,May 2019
494,Upgrade or go elsewhere,"Unless you want to pay for a suite, be prepared to be disappointed. Tiny rooms and bathrooms. Our didn’t have a dresser or any place to put clothes. Location is the only saving grace. In that photo, you can see the corner of the bed, the bathroom and the entrance. Room was maybe 150 square feet?",2,Travelin Man 89,May 2019
495,Loved it,"Second time staying at Hotel and both times rooms were clean. They've remodeled some room; so they are up dated and fresh. I will stay here again..its in the heart of time square, close to everything and staff is helpful and professional.",5,Vacay at JFK,May 2019
496,One of the highlights during my travel... and after.,"Good room ""Signature"", stair 12, good beds. Bathroom a little bit to small.Only one breakfast at Bond45, very very good.Good location, really near Time Square and a lot of point of interest.Many things to do just Simply Walking.Thanks to all the staff especially to Jonathan from hotel security service.He just did the job (He knows what I mean...).",4,Stephaudrey_88_76,April 2019
497,6 Night stay at the Edison Hotel,"We chose this hotel primarily for its location and on this aspect, it did not disappoint.  The hotel was very convenient for Times Square and Broadway and right in central Manhattan. In terms of the hotel itself, our room (1545) was extremely disappointing. It was right at the end of the corridor on the 15th floor, was very small and smelled a bit musty (as if a dog had been the previous occupant).  The windows were very difficult to open past a couple of inches - maybe for safety purposes - so it was difficult to air the room properly. There were no outside views worth mentioning from this room. That said, it was clean and tidy and the daily staff maintained it well.  The ensuite bathroom was small but adequate although the weird tap (faucet) operation takes a bit of practice!. The hotel was art deco style but it looked tired and dated.  The business suite, like most things in New York, incurred a charge of $3 for 15 minutes internet access so if you wanted to print off your boarding passes, you had to pay for the privilege. I had a problem with the IT in the business suite but the customer liaison staff were very helpful in sorting it out and arranging for me to be reimbursed with my $3. Make sure you fully understand all the charges that you will incur - there is the room charge, sales tax, city tax, occupancy tax, Javits centre tax, facility fee, facility fee sales tax and a facility fee city tax! Overall, I didn't feel it was great value for money and if I go to New York again, I would steer clear of Times Square hotels and stay further out and use the subway a bit more.",3,j0hnandjanice,April 2019
498,wonderful accomodation and location,the family suite was great and perfectly accomodating 5 people. although situated at Time Square room was very quiet. top service and staff very helpful and polite. it was not my first time in NY city but this time this hotel made the difference and my stay absolutely memorable. worth the price and will be my first choice in the future.,5,LZH,April 2019
499,Wonderful Accommodation. 96 Travellors,"Reservations, check in, luggage handling, room cleaning, elevator capacity, & check out: all PERFECTION!!!   And, affordable.Polite, friendly, & patient personnel.  Incredibly well-managed.  Excellent security.  Couldn’t be better!And, exquisite murals of hotel’s history throughout 46 Street entrance.Whether traveling as large group (as we were) or as individual, this is the center city Broadway Theater district hotel to select.",5,George D,May 2019
500,Location location,"My wife and I stayed at the Edison hotel during the Easter period. You can look around and feel the times gone by. Great hotel fantastic location. Good rooms. The hotel still has the charm of the period it was built but still maintains the modern touch’s were all use too. Great staff .fantastic jazz bar, which gets very busy later on when the band comes on. Get in early if you need a seat. We will definitely book this hotel again when we return.",5,adamia140,April 2019
501,Helpful staff,The hotel is situated off Times Square and considering its location the rooms are really quiet. We stayed on the 4th floor in one of the Classic rooms which had two Queen beds and a recently refurbished bathroom. The room was really clean and big enough for the two of us. There is plenty of storage space with a seperate closet and also a safe in the room. There was a daily maid service and complimentary bottled water left every day. The only thing that was missing was a coffee machine. We had a problem with the air conditioning which was fixed really quickly when reported to reception (within the hour) and couldn't ask for more. You have to show your room card when going to your room which is a really good security feature. The staff are really friendly and very helpful from reception to the door man (Bob was really helpful in organising our taxi when we needed one to the airport). There is also the option to store your luggage after check out (noon) for $1 per bag which is really cheap for NY. Would definitely stay at this hotel again when back in New York.,4,Loulou372,April 2019
502,NYC Sister Trip,"This hotel is in a great location. There is easy access to Times Square, restaurants, and plays. You can enter and/or exit on parallel streets. We felt safe there. You have to show your room key card to access the elevators.",5,ddeseam,April 2019
503,Extreme professionalism and accommodating,"Cannot fault our stay here, absolutely brilliant from start to finish. The room was very clean and cosy, the staff were really friendly, the location was perfect just off times square and our overall was just the best.",5,Curious33467687806,April 2019
504,Perfect,We arrived and had no queue to wait in before checking in. This was just luck. Security staff at the elevators to ensure only guests enter. We were fortunate enough to be put in a newly refurbished room which was on good quality. Didn’t try the food or bar but the rum bar always sounded lively. I would stay here again,5,Adam G,April 2019
505,Happy Birthday to me,"We stay at Hotel Edison several times a year.  Over that time I have been there when they are swamped.  Under difficult circumstances the staff is unfailing friendly and helpful, like Tex, who you will find at the front desk, he's knowledgeable about a number of NYC things, but I enjoyed discussing the NYC Marathon with him, and Bellman Fehait who is originally from Kosovo with whom I've had very interesting conversations.  We arrived on a Friday in time to partake of the very fun reception that starts at 5.  Those in the know line up a bit early.  All of the Guest Relations people are on hand and make everyone feel like they are old friends.  Good food and great entertainment.  As most people point out the location can't be beat and maybe we are lucky but I've never been disappointed with out room.  Occasionally we have upgraded if we wound up entertaining, and the housekeeping staff has gotten us extra chairs or glasses as needed.  The iced coffee at Friedman's (the restaurant off the lobby) is the best there is and don't get me started on the breads basket.  Hope you all enjoy your stay as much as we do.",5,April45,April 2019
506,Great location,"If you're looking for a safe and clean hotel near Times Square or the Theater District this hotel is highly recommended. There is security at the elevators and the rooms are clean but as expected in New York City, they are small.",4,Melissa M,April 2019
507,Disappointing,"The hotel is in a brilliant position, a minutes walk from Times Square and within walking distance of many ‘attractions’ - Central Park, The Rock & Empire State Building for example . However we were very disappointed with the rooms, the first room we were given was on the 12th floor , it was very small , very dated and the walls were filthy ..... we went back to reception and they offered  us another room , this room was still very small and very dated but was much cleaner so we decided to accept it. The poor quality of the room was not what we expected from a hotel in New York , we were very disappointed and would sadly not stay here again .",2,Joanne R,April 2019
508,A good base,"A great base for visiting Manhatten attractions.  Clean and quiet.  Comfortable beds.  Rooms cleaned daily.  Basic continental breakfast.Negative points....No kettle in room, facilities to make drinks 11 floors down. Pillows were VERY soft.Rusty plug whole in bath.No bar.No view from our room on 11th floor. Pretty expensive but it is Manhatten!",3,Polo1149,April 2019
509,Great place!,"As usual, a great experience! Together with my family, is the second time we go to this hotel, and we felt everywhere the authentic New York spirit. from the art deco architecture (I'm in love with) to the professional staff and the restaurants inside the hotel, everything proves a standard",5,Monica Andronic,April 2019
510,Definitely not worth the price paid,"The hotel is definitely not as nice as the website makes it out to be. Reception area is lovely, however, the rooms are no where near this calibre. Extremely dated, wallpaper dirty and peeling, bathroom tiny (2 people couldn’t not fit), window slightly ajar making it very noisy at night. We had 2 rooms booked ( 1 with 1 queen bed and another with 2 doubles) and the room with 1 queen bed was extremely small to the point where 2 large suitcases struggled to fit and the occupants were uncomfortable due to the lack of space. The only decent thing going for this hotel is that it’s in a prime location, which is definitely what you are paying for. Wouldn’t not stay here again unless desperate.",3,Lauren O,March 2019
511,Beware booking through Expedia,"I gave the Hotel Edison three stars.  It has many pros and only two cons, but the one of the cons is a big one!Pros: 1.  Location, location, location - around the corner from Times Square and Hell's Kitchen2.  Attentive staff - each request we made was immediately handled 3.  On-site restaurant - Fieldman's has an excellent breakfast 4.  Cleanliness - room was incredibly clean5.  Large room6.  Cheap price Cons:  1.  Ragged Carpet. Beat up furiture, cracked tile, peeling wallpaper - everything was in terrible condition.  My husband compared the room to one in a hostel.  Based on the room pictures shown on their website, I can only assume they save these ""special rooms"" for Expedia bookings. The bathroom has probably not been remodeled since the early 1960s.  Every single floor tile was chipped or cracked.  We were highly disappointed.2.  No coffee or tea maker - I honestly can't remember the last time I had a room without a coffeemaker3.  Only place to store clothes was the closet - this would not have been a problem except there was no lighting.  It was totally dark!  We literally needed a flashlight.4.  Tiny, tiny bathroomFortunately, the pros made up for the cons, at least for us. If you plan to book a room here (especially through Expedia) just know that your room may not look like anything displayed on their website.",3,ncthistle,April 2019
512,What a wonderful hotel! ,"We loved our one night stay with Hotel Edison. Our room was very clean and comfortable. The bed was so cozy! The Director of Rooms, Roger Lindsay, was incredibly helpful and accommodating. He answered all of our questions and offered suggestions of what to do while we were in Times Square. Thank you. We’ll be back!",5,Jonathan Dubey,April 2019
513,Poor Suite. Good location.,"Stayed here for four nights in April with my wife. We booked a suite as this was a birthday trip for both of us. The hotel itself is well located just off time square. I’m not sure why but outside is covered in scaffolding and has been for a few years. The suite itself was a signature on the 11th floor . Not sure what the signature gets you. The room itself is dated and badly needs new furniture and painting. The bed a king was big and comfortable. The bathroom is disgusting. See pictures below. Apart from having 3 inches between the loo and the wall, the whole room needs ripping out. Bath is broken. Tiles smashed and badly done quick repair jobs. The noise from the air con would wake the dead. And even when you have it off you can hear the rooms around you. Feel we got no value for an upgrade. Would consider again this hotel if renovated.",2,Dave_Connolly_13,April 2019
514,Birthday in NYC,Great location and friendly staff.  Room was very clean and on a high floor.  Plenty of elevators so you never wait long. The Rum lounge was fabulous.  Live entertainment was great and I had one of the best mojitos ever!,5,Soniayyz,April 2019
515,Great situation,This hotel is in a great position if you want to be in the thick of Times Square and close to bars and restaurants. If you do wish to stay here you must make sure you ask for their upgraded rooms. We travelled from England for a Ruby wedding celebration and after umpteen attempts to contact the hotel to tell them why we were there they placed us in one of their old smelly rooms. When we got out of the lift it was like a scene from the shining. All the doors on one side of the corridor were covered in plastic. The bedroom we were in stink to high heaven and the carpets were disgustingly filthy. The bathroom was something out of the Flintstones. The other bedroom was as bad as ours. However when we went down and complained they agreed to move us next day and they did. The new rooms are really nice and up to the standard one expects when paying to stay in a hotel. I would stay at this hotel again but only in the new refurbished rooms of course.,3,Coz2013,April 2019
516,Jewelry returned,"Last year I left my Rolex watch in my room and I called security in Hotel and ask forthe supervisor (Danny).  He was so great and made sure he got it back to me safe.This year we are staying again the most safe Hotel in New York!  Thank you again,Danny.",5,Sandra M,April 2019
517,Hotel Edison Times Square,Hotel Edison was a quaint hotel. Robbi Morris provided excellent customer service. The towels were soft and plush. Bed not so comfortable. Room location wasn’t great. Edison Hour was a nice touch. DeMarcus(?) provided good customer service also. Food was tasty. The restaurant had a tasty egg white omelette. Service was pretty good. I’d go back there and recommend to friends.,4,JWClay,April 2019
518,Great Location,"Had OK stay here at Edison Hotel, our stay was made better by Demarcus from customer relation who took on board our issues and acted on them. Location of hotel is very good and basically on Times Square.",4,Mark M,April 2019
519,Perfect location,Hotel is in the heart of TQ. Rooms are typically small for NY but they have everything you will need. Staff are very helpful and efficient. The hotel is constantly busy but nothing is too much trouble. All areas are spotlessly clean and housekeeping staff are fantastic.,4,Louise M,April 2019
520,great location,"hotel's location is very near times square and major theaters. very accessible to subway and bus stations. I hope the rennovations will soon be finished, so that the scaffoldings along walkways will be removed the earliest time.",4,joselitod897,April 2019
521,Reservation inquiry,Looking to stay at the hotel Edison in 2020 not officially booked called and spoke to a wonderful agent by the name of DJ this agent was phenomenal answered all my questions very detailed give me information about New York City and everything that a tourist first-time visitor to New York would want to know give this person a pay raise or a free lunch. They were very outgoing professional amazing friendly you should be proud to have people working for you like this person. Can't wait to book a reservation in 2020 looking so forward to meeting DJ hope this reservation agent is still there. Sincerely  Adventures of David and Aaron. Follow us on YouTube like subscribe and share,5,David,April 2019
522,Fantastic locations and value,"I have stayed at Hotel Edison several times over the last decade and I have seen this hotel evolve from a rundown, below average hotel to a remodeled, great value for your money at a great location Art Deco jewel. During our last stay we really enjoyed a spacious and well appointed Signature room. The staff was friendly and efficient and the restaurant on site offered a great breakfast.The great location, half a block from the bustle of Times Square, comes at a price though. That price is noise, unavoidable even at our 18th story room. Other than that, this hotel is highly recommended.",4,TampaDocFoodie,April 2019
523,Our Favorite NYC Hotel!,"The location of the Edison is perfect, we were just a short walk from the three shows we came to see. The staff is friendly, the service is excellent & the Signature rooms were amazing!! Our family comes to NYC a few of times a year to see shows & we love it! This trip we brought our Mother-in Law for her 75th Birthday, & it was her first trip to NYC. She commented that her room was ""nice, really small, but at least it's clean"" & we laughed telling her by NYC standards the rooms were Awesome! (Our family likes to joke that if you don't roll out of bed & onto the toilet, your room is HUGE!) Our rooms at the Edison were wonderful-spacious & luxurious! Above Satisfactory by ""normal"" hotel standards, but by NYC (and European) standards, it's a wonderful room!! Not only was there enough room in the bathroom for two people, but my 6'4"" husband didn't have to sit sideways because his broad shoulders didn't fit between the walls framing the toilet! There was plenty of room to walk around the bed, the closet was not only large, but a walk in! The room was spotless & the bed was comfortable. I was very happy with our stay!! The doorman was friendly & helpful, the front desk staff filled with smiles, and even the cleaning staff were happy and smiling! I love being in a place were people seem to love their jobs.  I just love the ambiance of the Edison!! On this Trip, I was reminded why we liked it better in the first place, & why we won't be staying at any other hotel when visiting NYC!!!",5,BruinsDJ,April 2019
524,The Hotel Edison Is An Art Deco Gem!,"We had a Signature Suite, a Signature King and a Signature Queen room for our group's stay early in March. The rooms were excellent. We needed additional lighting in the living room of the suite, and Engineering brought us a couple of additional floor lamps almost immediately. Guest relations and Concierge could could not have been better! We were extremely well taken care of. Friedman's is a good breakfast/lunch spot. The Rum Bar is probably the best bar in or near Times Square. And Bond 45 is a killer restaurant! You will be knocked out by the lobby murals and the exquisite Art Deco detailing thought the property. If you're going to be near Times Square, it's hard to beat the Hotel Edison.",5,Frank C,March 2019
525,Edison Times Square,Hotel in a wonderful location steps from Time Square. Extremely pleasant and helpful staff. Excellent security in place.  We always book a signature room which is lovely and very comfortable.  The hotel also has two excellent restaurants. All round a great hotel for a stay in Manhattan,5,GumbetScotland,April 2019
526,Perfect family hotel in Midtown,"We stayed in the Family room which was perfect for our 2 teenaged boys as they had their own bedroom separate from us but still connected to our room. The location is fantastic for exploring so much of Manhattan, and although Times Square is literally around the corner, we weren’t disturbed by the noise and slept extremely well in the large, comfy beds. The rooms are a great size and we made good use of the fridge and table & chairs in the room when we were too exhausted to go out for food. (There is also a microwave if you need it). It was our first trip to Manhattan and staying at Hotel Edison made the experience a very special one for all four of us!",5,Erika R,April 2019
527,Very good hotel,"It´s very good located. Next to Times Square. The neighborhood is safe.  The hotel is Ok. The rooms are very clean and the staff very friendly. The bed was confortable and if was enough soundproof so nobody disturbs you. The only con is the room needed an upgrade, it was old. But they were upgrading the hotel. They keep your luggage if you need the check out day.",4,Meander51801927697,April 2019
528,Noisy but clean.,"Edison Hotel is a little dated inside and the rooms we had were small with a variety of bathrooms which seemed to indicate some refurbishment had taken place but it was pot luck if your room had been lucky or not.Rooms are compact, which is pretty standard this close to Times Square, if you don't pay for a view you don't get one and end up on the lower floors, again pretty standard for the immediate area. The room itself was clean and the bed reasonable, bathroom was average with very poor lighting (Just one light over the mirror) standard shower over bath.Main problem however was the noise, firstly from outside, the noise reverberates around the rear and secondly from the incredibly noisy window mounted air-conditioners. In April we could get by just without it but once it get's hotter and you need it on for comfort I very much doubt you'll get any sleep as it sounds like a jet engine 2 feet from your pillow.Check in was slow and it could get very crowded at times, if you need to be in Times Square then you can't go wrong with the location, we wouldn't stay there again though mainly due to the noisy rooms.",3,Andy H,April 2019
529,New York at its best ,"I booked this hotel 8 months prior to my visit and read every review posted prior to booking and then every review prior to my visit. I was so nervous that I would be let down on my 8 night vacation. This was my third visit to NYC and on the prior visits I’d stayed at bigger brand hotels and been disappointed by the size of room and lack of atmosphere within the hotel. The Edison is a classic and I couldn’t have been happier with the stay. We had a Classic Family suite and it was remarkably good, big, clean, modern yet retro and had the comfiest beds.The choice of diners close by make the options of dining so vast and if you want to stay in the hotel the in-house options are great. Friedman’s within the hotel was a stroke of genius and is well worth a visit. The whole experience from when we checked in with Justina right through until check out 8 nights later was awesome. We felt safe, looked after and happy so what more could you ask for.",5,JJ5family,April 2019
530,One of many visits to the Hotel Edison,"We have been staying only at the Edison for many years.  Friedman's restaurant has such a full-service menu and the restoration is very beautiful.  Additionally, the 46th-47th walk-through is convenient and accommodating.The staff (front desk, doorpersons, reservations, maids) were all interactive and positive.",5,Meander15019778730,April 2019
531,Theater and Dining weekend in NYC !! Terrific Hotel,Weekend stay for theater and dining. Great location. The nicely renovated room w/ terrace offered a some view of the times square/ theater area. I recommend the higher floor as you are close to noisy Times Square. The terrace does open and you can stand outside. We had breakfast at Friedmans and loved the late night piano bar at The Rum House.  One of the few piano bars in NYC. Everyone was helpful and pleasant. Easy choice to come back here.,5,Bob S,April 2019
532,"Amazing location, some rooms need to be updated","Great location right next to times square and lots to see and do around. Easy access to subway and plenty of nearby restaurants. I found that the check in was a bit slow but Sam at check-in very nice and helpful. Be careful of resort fees they seem to be adding those even if your prepaid reservation indicates that it includes all taxes and fees. The agent at the front desk was understanding the situation and in the end waived those. It has an historic charm to it but not all the rooms have been renovated. They seem to be renovating some floors so there was a bit of noise during day time but was quiet at night. We didn't get a renovated room so there was a bit of a smell in the rooms, likely due to humidity from the shower not well ventilated. The rooms are small, and so is the bathroom, we were there as a family of 4 and it was a bit of a squeeze. Overall we were happy with our stay and the staff was generally friendly and helpful. They have a restaurant and a bar in the hotel which were convenient and I will review those separately.",4,Roaming_user,April 2019
533,Memory making family trip,"The hotel was in a great location in Times Square, staff always happy to help and gave great service. I would definitely recommend this hotel, we travelled as a family but it would suit any traveller.",5,Kelly,April 2019
534,Weekend Stay in Hotel Edison in NYC,One of  friendliest places in town.   Rooms were clean and well stocked.   All staff was extremely pleasant and helpful.  The quality of food in the restaurant and cafe was outstanding.   Would definitely stay there again.,5,262dorisn,April 2019
535,Tour group,"Check in was a shambles. Marcus was extremely rude. Our tour group had arrived earlier in the day and left our cases in a room. When returning to check in I was asked for passport or drivers license for id. These were locked in my case upstairs. Marcus stated he could not check me in without id but would not allow me to go up to get my case and id until I was checked in. We went round and round with this until Marcus then had me escorted upstairs like a criminal to get my case and id. To my surprise I was escorted to my room-I stayed to the staff member that I needed to get my case as I wasn’t checked in yet. He asked me where my case was?  To this I replied I did not know as we all just went in the lift with a staff member to a room and left our bags. By now it was over half an hour that I had been trying to check in to this hotel. The room number was finally given to the staff member and I was escorted to my case where I showed my passport and was then handed my room key like it was no big deal. A big fuss had been made by Marcus, it could have been handled much better. Hotel Edison is obviously a very old hotel and has many flaws such as very old bathroom taps,bath with enamel flaking off etc but I found it charming and comfortable during my stay.",3,Debonleave,April 2019
536,Great week in New York,"My wife and i just spent a week in New York..... after doing some searching for a suitable hotel, we decided on The Hotel Edison. We had a wonderful week in this beautiful hotel, the room with king bed was a good size, clean with lots of storage space and an exceptional bathroom with a walk-in shower. The staff was excellent...very helpful. The location was perfect with a 2 minute walk to Times Square. A wonderful hotel that i would highly recommend.",5,Mitchell B,April 2019
537,Not as expected for a Hotel at this location.,This hotel location is excellent however you should compare to see if it is really worth for the money charged to you.  I am sure I will not use this Place ever again when I can Pay similar tag and have a top of the line place to stay.,2,Roam66647052780,April 2019
538,Birthday Treats,"This was part of my partner and her nephews treat,first we've stayed at this hotel.After a shaky start when they had failed to upgrade one of the rooms,although they had confirmed they had,this period hotel is centrally located,our rooms were satisfactory,the ladies and gents preparing the rooms were always polite.We did have some noisy neighbours,and the early start by someone with a pneumatic drill,were a tad irritating,but overall our stay was pleasant.One other observation,please turn the heating down at night,couldn't leave a/c as it was to noisy,even talking to one of your staff they said it was 'to damn hot' their words.I would recommend this hotel.",4,barry j,April 2019
539,Disappointed,"I did not realize that with my desire to stay in a historical place, I would have to compromise on quality. The pictures of the rooms are no where near the actual. Housekeeping stored bins and vacuum in the open and outside my door so had to navigate around. That is 1 star quality.",2,Pnorring,April 2019
540,Great Times @ the Square,Excellent location @ the heart of it all. Great service and accommodations. Rooms were Clean and very comfortable. Security was good. Lobby was always full but their fast service helps move fast.  Lower restaurants are good but really over priced fir what they sell. But Hotel location and service is for what Is worth the money.,5,FarAway29143241478,April 2019
541,Unhappy,"This hotel is not what it appears on the website. It is clearly a 2-3 star with only 3 stalls in the lobby area for people checking in and out, waiting for a car, and the cafe...it was a horrible visit. The rooms are small and cramped as well as outdated!",1,M E,April 2019
542,Wonderful Art Deco decor only surpassed by uncommon modern service,"We were so pleasantly surprised by this hotel just off Times Square - the price for Easter weekend was one of the best we found. The boutique atmosphere & personal service is so rare in big cities. While our room was small - it was quiet, lovely  ,well set up and very clean. Will definitely return",5,Adele B,April 2019
543,Hotel edison,"Absolutely first class service from checking in to leaving, room was excellent, security was great having to show your room key before being allowed to enter lifts,rum bar was excellent with really good music,and the cocktails were amazing",5,"Anth and carol Parkinson,england",April 2019
544,Great week in Times Square,"The Hotel Edison is a clean, comfortable, reasonably priced hotel located in Times Square, where all of the action is. It is within a few blocks of all of the Broadway theaters and we took great advantage of that. All of the hotel personnel, without exception, were warm and friendly.

546,"choose this hotel! Great location, friendly with great rooms!","The hotel Edison is  a lovely hotel in a great location. I booked this as a surprise birthday present for my husband. He usually books the holidays and locations so I was a little apprehensive as this isn't our usual hotel. I contacted the hotel prior to arrival to arrange a wine package on arrival and the staff were so helpful in making this birthday treat special!! De'marcus from guest relations was amazing and went above and beyond to make this holiday special and he certainly achieved this. The room was amazing, and very clean and the bed so comfortable, even the bed settee was amazing 😉 the staff were really helpful and friendly and made us feel so welcome. We traveled with our 6 year old and the location to time square, bus routes, restaurants etc was ideal!I would definitely recommend this hotel to family and friends, we received great service especially from the amazing De'Marcus, and we look forward to visiting the hotel Edison again soon. What an amazing holiday and great hotel.",5,Joanne,April 2019
547,"Ok, but not great","I'm perplexed by all of the rave reviews here. We stayed in December of 2018 and were not impressed. Our room didn't look like the other traveler photos on the site. Literally every single piece of furniture was damaged and chipping. The bathroom looked like it hadn't been updated in decades. The toilet was one you'd see in a public restroom. We prepaid for a souvenir teddy bear but didn't receive it (didn't follow up and ask either.) Location is ok if you want to be in Times Square. But if you want to be someplace less touristy and a little more subdued, I'd suggest looking elsewhere.On the upside, the bed was reasonably comfy and Friedman's restaurant next door was really good, and convenient. (You can enter from the hotel lobby.) I think we were supposed to receive meal vouchers for Friedman's but did not, unfortunately.Overall, it's ok, but we wouldn't stay there again. There are other, nicer hotels in good locations that would probably be more comfortably and better kept. But if it works for you and you want to be in Times Square and/or the theater district, then ok.",3,PlaneJane123,December 2018

550,The Perfect New York City Hotel,"Great value for money, friendly and helpful staff, newly renovated rooms, a short walk to any Broadway show, gorgeous art deco murals throughout the lobby...there are so many reasons to love this hotel. But it also provides excellent value for money and has comfortable and quiet rooms that let you get away from it all and enjoy a great night's sleep. I have found my ""home away from home"" in new York City!!",5,Gordon M,April 2019
551,Great hotel. Perfect location.,"Very nice, clean and comfortable hotel room & bathroom. Hotel is perfectly located for attending Broadway shows. The staff is very helpful and responsive to guests’ needs.  Reasonably priced. Very good value for your money. Strongly recommend Hotel Edison.",5,Gloria V,April 2019
552,"Location great, rooms not so great","My daughter and I were in the hotel for 6 nights. When we checked in at the reception, the lady there immediately proposed it might be better if we took an upgrade for 40 dollars a night because the standard rooms are very basic. That first evening - after a long journey from Belgium - we only wanted to cry when we saw the room. So old-fashioned! The wallpaper was peeling off and there were cracks in the walls and doors. We laid down on the beds for a while and thought about it but decided not to pay more for another room because we wouldn't be there much so it was only to sleep and have a shower. The location is great and I would recommend the hotel only for that reason.",3,Katja L,April 2019
553,Excellent Location,A friend and I recently had a 10 day stay at the Edison and found it to be perfect for our needs. It is centrally located and has good amenties.Having security next to the elevators was comforting for two women travelling alone.Room was clean and comfortable. Bathroom was tiny and could do with an extractor fan as it was hot and steamy after a shower.Only ate at Friedmans once - this was about a 3/5 compared with our experiences at other diners and eateries around the city.All in all I would recommend this hotel and would use again if I'm ever lucky enough visit the city again.,5,Apollo8,April 2019
554,My favourite place,"My 2nd visit to Hotel Edison and it was just as wonderful as I remembered from my first visit.I only used this hotel as a base to visit the city so did not make use of the full facilities.   It is currently undergoing renovations and I was on a floor that was being renovated, not that it disturbed me at all.The room was sparkling clean and just what I needed for my stay. The staff are super polite and friendly. The accessories, such as an umbrella in every room, just make the difference. I will be back!!",5,holidaymaker130301,April 2019
555,The Edison is the Place to Stay,"The Edison is well maintained, comfortable, and affordable.  Staff are friendly and helpful.

557,"Good value, bring earplugs","For the price, it was small, but reasonable and clean. The room was a little tired. Mismatched everything - to be expected for a room that's not yet been updated in a hotel undergoing full restoration. At this price point, in this location, my only large concern is the sheer volume of noise at all hours of night (it was actually much quieter during the day). I was on the 5th floor and there was jackhammering at 2 am so loud that earplugs only mildly blocked some of the noise. Sirens and car horns sounded like they were 10 feet away. I hope the renovation helps dampen noise, as this is a great, convenient location with a ton of promise once renovation is complete.",4,214Dreaming808,March 2019
558,"Excellent Location, Comfortable Rooms, Nice Amenities","I've stay three times now at the Edison, and I will likely stay there again. The midtown location is almost perfect, especially if you are interested in Broadway shows and Times Square. Even if you are not, it is very centrally located and a short walk to all the major subway lines, lots of cabs available. There are numerous restaurants, shops, etc. within blocks, and you can literally be in Times Square in a few steps out the door. There is an access on both 47th and 46th Streets, and the 46th street access is directly across from the two block throughway of sorts that gets you all the way to 44th street with ease. You are at the heart of Manhattan. The staff are excellent and accommodating. The facilities are always very clean and have the old-style luxury about them. The beds are very comfortable, and the rooms have been remodeled in recent years. Nice showers. Little pluses include free bottled water in the rooms, free wi-fi, quality organic soaps and shampoos, in-room safe, weekday receptions with free food and drinks, plenty of elevators, and more. My one complaint would be that there is no refrigerator in the rooms I've stayed in. Also, it feels very safe and secure. I will definitely stay at the Edison again.",5,FritzGreen,April 2019
559,Outstanding Place to Stay!,"This is a great hotel and location.  Everyone was extremely helpful and nice, especially Robbi.  Robbi went above and beyond to be nice and helpful to our family, and it was a pleasure getting to know him.

563,Not great,"When arriving at the hotel we were given the wrong type of room but after a visit back to reception, this was then rectified.  However, the room given was on a floor that active refurbishment was taking place so the room was seriously dated with a number of issues.We couldn't close the bathroom door as the handle kept coming off, trapping the person in the bath room!You were unable to open windows so was forced to use the air conditioning which sounded like a jet engine was in the room and made it difficult to sleep or even watch TV. With active refurbishment going on around us, this came with noise and the workers weren't bothered by the Do Not Disturb sign on the door so we were woken whenever they decided to start work.Breakfast in one restaurant is a buffet which has a nice selection of food and the other is a fixed menu.  Both deliver service which is awful. We waited a long time for coffee in the Bond 45 restaurant and had almost finished our breakfast before it finally arrived and I'm not even sure we would have received it if we didn't chase the waiter twice!The Friedmans restaurant had lovely food in large portions however we ordered the smoothy one morning which took 25 minutes to reach our table! It came with a pile of shredded coconut on the top.  One of our party did not like coconut and scooped this off and placed it on a plate in order to be able to drink the rest. When the waiter returned our friend was the beratted for doing this and was told she could have asked for it to not be on her drink rather than make a mess on a plate.  This would be fine except the ingredients were not stated on the menu! He then went on to argue with her stating that none of the other ingredients are listed either and she was fine with those! Incredibly rude service and be aware, you are expected to be a mind reader on the ingredients of everything on all menus. If you have allergies or intolerance to anything, be aware that you have to state this!The concierge was great! Giving good advice on using the subway and booking a transfer.  Probably the nicest member of staff we encountered and he wasn't even an American! He was very knowledgeable.All other staff members we encountered seemed to give the impression that they would want to be somewhere else!Being a guest in the hotel felt like it inconvenienced them. I hate to say the level of service you get in all other places we visited in New York put this hotel to shame.  I'm not normally one to do a low star review and can usually find some good in where we stay but I struggled with this hotel which I am really disappointed about.",2,Emma G,April 2019
564,"Location, Location, Location!","If you want to be in Times Square, this is the hotel for you.  If you want guaranteed quiet, maybe not.  I stayed for 3 nights the first week in April with a group of high school students.  The hotel was fantastic to work with.  I ate one night in one of the restaurants and it was very good.  We had breakfast down the street at Carve, very good and very inexpensive. The lobby is fantastic for gathering the kids before we left for the day and evenings.  Our rooms were what was expected, some larger than others.  They were significantly larger than the Paramount where we stayed two years ago.  A lot more room for our students which were 4 to a room.  We hired security for our students every night to make sure they stayed put and to keep the noise down.  Our chaperone's had to speak with other groups students that were on the same floor as us several times.  It would be great if the hotel suggested other groups hire security as well, it is very inexpensive.",5,Dee B,April 2019
565,Great hotel!!,The hotel location was perfect right in times square! Very clean and secure!

566,Edison the perfect spot ,"Hotel Edison New YorkWe stayed at the hotel Edison in February 2019 in New York and the best thing about it was the location. We were right in the heart of the city, Times Square, Broadway with all the main attractions within walking distance. We loved it.I went with 3 of my best friends for a girlie trip, just to sight see and explore New York so we weren’t looking for luxury, having said that the hotel was quite good.Four of us stayed in the same room two double beds and comfy, or it could have been the fact that we were so tired every night that we definitely didn’t feel any pea under the mattress. Sheets were clean, our beds were made everyday and bottles of water replenished. They gave us a coffee machine as well as a kettle for our English tea. We had wardrobe space, tv, radio where we could connect our phones to. Plug points all around the room so no  taking turns in charging all our technology.The bathroom was adequate, probably needs updating, to me as long as their was water and towels I didn’t really care. They replenished shampoos and shower gels and other toiletries. However, there is one really bad point of the room we were staying in and that was that the pipes made a lot of noise in the middle of the night, apparently it was warming up the whole system for the whole hotel and it happened to be right near our room and if you’re a light sleeper then forget an Undisturbed  sleep. Although by the second night the noise had become slightly faint. The rooms were very warm but there is aircon if you need to cool down. Staff are very helpful and friendly always greet you with a smile.There are two restaurants in the hotel and both very nice, Friedman’s I preferred for breakfast as they had the best avacado on toast and crispy bacon as well as the most fluffiest pancakes. The other was Bond 45, dinner lighting, nice cocktails and lunch crisp and filling. But better than this was the famous Rum house featured in many films such as the Birdman live music and good cocktails. However there are many restaurants and bars very close to the hotel as it is in the theatre district and very close to Juniors where the famous New York cheesecake is as well as great burgers. Overall you will not get bored staying at the Edison because it is in the best location ever and close walking distance to all the famous landmarks, try it you won’t regret it.",4,toyalbayat,February 2019
567,Pictures on web site not what you will get!,Don’t be fooled by the lovely picture of the rooms as they are nothing like this!!!! The rooms are old fashioned and in need of some TLC.

568,40th birthday present,Enjoyable stay at Edison.  Perfect location beside Times Square.  We had a Signature Room. Small but very clean. I recommend the Signature Room. They have been  updated  recently I was told. Overall we enjoyed our stay.,5,Angela M,April 2019
569,Hotel Edison,When we originally arrived at the hotel we were given a tiny room which was not suitable for myself and my mum to share. We asked in reception if we could be moved room and the man on the reception desk was so helpful and quickly got us put into a new room which was amazing - 2 queen beds with lots of storage space. Bathroom was small but toiletries and towels were restocked every day as well as the room being tidied. The hotel was in a great location and all the staff were so helpful with any questions we asked. I need to specially mention Maurice Ottolia. My mum accidentally left her rings in the safe in the hotel room and we only realised after getting off the plane at Edinburgh. As I went to email to ask about this I saw that Maurice had already emailed me to notify me of the issue. Maurice had these items shipped straight away to my home address and also was able to resolve an issue with FedEx when they tried to charge customs taxes of £200. Thank you Maurice for your honesty and ensuring the rings were returned safely.,4,Pamela,February 2019
570,A few days in NYC with my husband,We booked the Edison due to their central location and security. It was generally a good hotel with a nice lobby and functioning security- we forgot our passports in the safe and they kept them safe for us and called to let us know which we appreciate very much. The rooms were not very nice though- quite run down and old with an unfresh odour. Of course we didn’t spend much time in the room but for the cost of the hotel it was disappointing. The hotel is located pretty much on Broadway and is just a stone’s throw from Times Square which was fantastic as we were on foot.,3,Emma’s travels,August 2018

572,very very noisy room...,"Room 2220, 22nd floor, very very very noisy, not only due to the vicinity of Times Square but also the machinery on the roof (?) , the windows are poor quality and the cold wind could enter from every side.The hotel is ongoing maintenance both outside and inside and  we had some kind of grinder noise from the outside as well as a nice view of the worker legs thru the window. The bathroom is extra small but the beds are super comfortable. Plenty of electrical plus and USB plug to charge your devices. Iron and ironing table available in the room.The safe is big enough to accommodate a full size ipad.Our neighbours were extremely noisy when closing their room door and speaking loud in the room , the rooms do not seems to be properly insulated.the room doors have a good centimeter of gap at their bottom so that we needed to put a used towel on the bottom not to get cold air and noise in.The bathroom door is glass so we were disturbed by the daylight coming from the small window located in the shower.The room window curtains are roll type, very poor quality, impossible to get full darkness.Water bottles supplied free of charge.We had a small bag full of goodies at the check inn , the kids enjoyed the teddy bear very much.The staff not extremely smiling but professional.

For the location, price, and amenities,  you cannot beat the Hotel Edison.  We were within walking distance of so many attractions, and even when we had to take the subway, it was very convenient to the Edison.  By New York standards, their rooms are quite roomy.   Bed was extremely comfortable; bathroom was downright luxurious!  Two restaurants on site.  We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, and U highly recommend the Hotel Edison!  Its dedication where I will stay on my next visit!",5,Wanda R,April 2019
576,Incredible Location!,"I selected this hotel because it is truly in the heart of the Theatre District!  As a native New Yorker who moved away 30 years ago, but regularly returns to see family and friends, I had never stayed in a NY hotel for non-business related purposes.  So, after all these years, this was a first!  And it was a great choice.  The reception staff were incredibly professional and welcoming after changing our room three times (undergoing renovations on one floor and the possible dust impacting my asthma was one reason and not wanting to be on a lower floor was another)!  The lobby is an elegant example of Art Deco design. The room is small (not surprising, given NYC norms) and does need upgrades, i.e., a bed stand with plug in's for electrical devices, more hooks to put hand and bath towels, and very minimally, a coffee/tea appliance could be placed on a built in shelf.  But we were out and about, not in the room, with easy access to subways to get to Staten Island, Brooklyn, uptown and out to Long Island.  And best of all, if you are planning to see Hamilton, the theatre is literally across the street!  I would, absolutely, again stay at the Hotel Edison.",4,Seaside390562,April 2019

579,Sally,"I’ve just returned from a 5 night stay at the Edison with my 3 children. The reason for our trip was to celebrate our significant birthdays. Before setting off on our journey I emailed the hotel to explain this trip would be extra special because of our celebration birthdays. The hotel very kindly left a bottle of wine, chocolate cookie, sweets and a souvenir teddy for each of us. When we arrived we were made to feel very welcome. The rooms were spacious very clean and very comfortable. Although my sons bathroom was quite small, it wasn’t a major problem. On our third night I realised my heating was not working, so I informed reception and literally within a minute of me retuning back to my room an engineer arrived to fix the problem. Unfortunately he could not fix it that day but he promptly returned with an electric heater for the interim. The following day it was repaired. We slept well, although it was quite noisy at times, but that’s what you would expect being so close to Times Square. For us it was the ideal location as it is so central. I previously read reviews on the Edison before I booked and did read comments that said the rooms shown on their website are not necessarily the exact style, in which you would receive . I presume this is because of an ongoing update/refurb that will happen. Although our rooms weren’t as modern as the pictures, we were not at all disappointed. Overall we enjoyed staying at the Edison and if I’m ever fortunate enough to return to New York I would definitely stay at this hotel again.",4,Sally H,April 2019

Lovely treat, they do this on Tuesdays also. Our room had two very small single beds but they were comfortable. The room was kept very clean and the staff were very friendly and accommodating if you were not ready for them to do your room they came back later. We were on the fourth floor no street noise but air conditioning unit outside was noisy at times. I really had only one reason for not rating this hotel excellent and that was WiFi it was really bad.  I would say for the five nights I was there I probably had 5 minutes WiFi. I had a WiFi signal but it did not connect only for about a minute and then went down.",4,Bernadette O,April 2019

We went here for my husbands 50th Birthday and wanted to be in the centre of the action - and we were.  However the hotel is quite dated - whilst it was very clean , the staff were attentive and the facilities were great the rooms leave a little to be desired.  The bathroom was tiny and the room space too however we were in the room for very little time.  We did however have a corner room which can us great dual aspect views and from floor 11 this was good.  It depends on your preference of location over space - because in my opinion with this hotel you do no get both.

The Edison is in an amazing location with anything you need just a stone's throw away.  We were greeted warmly and with smiles by staff from the valet out front, to the front desk, to housekeeping.  We arrived too early for check in and our bags were stored for us while we took in the city and attended a show.  We returned later to check in and retrieved our bags and went to our room, which was newly renovated.  We were greeted along the way by staff in the elevator and in the halls. Everyone was very friendly.  Our room was very clean!  The bathroom is typically a source of anxiety for me in hotels but this was not an issue here.  It's tiny, but clean. We were out of our room for the remainder of the time and enjoyed some jazz in the Rum Bar late in the evening.  Highly recommend Hotel Edison.

595,Good for a group ,"I personally hate staying near Times Square when I go to NYC, but for this trip I was traveling with a school group and this was the location that was best for our purposes. If you like to stay in around Times Square, this location can’t be beat. It is literally steps away from all of the madness. It is easy to walk to the theaters and other places in Midtown. It is also close to the subway. We were on the 9th floor and could hear tons of street noise, so we turned our air on at night to drown some of that out. It got freezing cold, but others in our group complained that their rooms wouldn’t cool off. My room was a great size. I honestly wasn’t expecting quite that big of a room; however the bathroom was so small. They could have taken an extra couple of feet out of the bedroom and added it to the bathroom. At the very least, it would be great if they added some kind of shelf or cabinet or something in the bathroom to put your stuff in. There’s literally nowhere to set anything down except for maybe a toothbrush and a bar of soap. My only other complaint would be how dark the room is. The lighting in the room itself is terrible, especially for getting ready, doing makeup, etc. It felt a little like a cave. The housekeeping was good, and we always had fresh water bottles each day. Queen beds were perfectly comfortable. This is a pretty busy hotel - the lobby was hopping all the time. It definitely doesn’t have a relaxing, sit in the lobby kind of vibe, which I don’t care about, but maybe some people do. If you want to be pretty much in Times Square and if you don’t care about a luxurious, relaxing hotel, this hotel would definitely be a good choice.",3,honeybasil,April 2019
596,Smack bang in the middle of Time Square,This hotel is perfect for people who like to be in the middle of it all. Literally less then 50 steps to Time Square. The staff are amazing. Have been there 3 times now and will definitely be back! Once I told them it was my husbands birthday and when we got back to the room there were balloons and everything. Another time we were due to go to the Dominican after NYC but Hurricane Irma hit so we didn’t know what we were going to do. They upgraded our room us for a few days until we sorted flights etc. They were so helpful.,5,Kara Quinn,July 2018
597,Sisters do NYC,If you like the action of Time Square then this is the best location. The Hotel is older but kept clean. Walls are thick so the rooms are quiet. Queen beds were adequate. Rooms are bigger than most in NYC.  Housekeeping is superb. There is free water bottles. You can ask for coffee maker. Very safe feel to the hotel.,4,patty p,April 2019
598,Stay Here!,"This was such a wonderful place to stay - convenient, clean, friendly. What more would you want? Front Desk, Baggage Holding, Elevator Security, Housekeeping, and Information Desk were all top notch and very helpful. This is definitely my place to stay on future NYC trips.",5,Chrise T,April 2019
599,Best way to ring in my birthday ,I can’t say enough about this hotel.  Everyone went out of their way to please me.  The hotel is brand new and absolutely gorgeous!  My room was up high and had an amazing view.  The bed was so comfortable that I slept later than I have in years!  And the 9th floor bar.  The best!! Stunning and unique with great food and drinks. Thank you for a wonderful stay!  Can’t wait to return in July!,5,Lovefood49,April 2019
600,Poor,"Still here now. Booked as an anniversary holiday for my husband and I.  Selected a signature king size room. Very disappointed with the room. Very dark, none of the “facilities” listed on the website. No fridge no docking station poor bathroom with an old useless shower that barely works over an old bath with a shower curtain. Description said marble bathroom with shower !! Just noticed that we are supposed to have robes as the hanger states we will be fined if not there when we depart ? Was never there in the first place. Paying $22/day in fees for -3bottles if water and WiFi that barely works. I did ask at the reception yesterday to see if they had possibly put us in the wrong room. No -we had a king size bed -therefore it is a signature king size room. We could have a fridge if we wanted ??! Poor customer service. An expensive, tired dark room in needs of lots of tlc",2,N3737AEhelent,April 2019
601,Great location,Staff at reception were not overall friendly but security and cleaners were great Rooms are being refurbished Bathrooms are tiny Great location near times square Central Park  Macys Empire State and Cryslar building are all walkable,3,Tracey K,April 2019
602,Good location and enjoyable stay!,"My wife and I stayed here in February. Overall we had a very enjoyable stay.  Although the hotel is not cheap and extra room taxes are added on, this was to be expected because it is Manhattan.  We arrived to the hotel late at night but the check in process was smooth and professional.  The staff were always polite and approachable.  The room itself was fine, small but had all the amenities required - a comfortable king sized bed, a nice bathroom, fairly big tv and a coffee machine.  I requested a mini-fridge in advance and the hotel kindly obliged.  The best thing about the hotel is the location being right on Times Square - restaurants, attractions and public transport all on your doorstep.   I didn't eat at any of the hotel restaurants but I must make special mention of the Rum House which you must check out - great live music, good vibe and nice drinks.  I would recommend this as a great place to stay in New York and a great base to explore the city.",4,norxis,February 2019
603,Good Location and friendly staff,"On the middle of Times Square, very friendly staff (Front desk, bellman and house keeping) make our stay very comfortable. Extra star for front desk TEX, always very friendly and very helpful with all informations. We will be back for sure.",5,Hillary Petterson,April 2019
604,Weekend at the Edison,"I was pleased to be right in the middle of Times Square at a clean, safe hotel with wonderful accommodations.Walking distance from everywhere and the energy of New York permeates the place.Good food on sight and swinging Bar with live Jazz too!",5,Resort17544330418,April 2019
605,No more!,3rd time staying here and my last. Had 2 good experiences before but gone very downhill. Queen room needs updating!! Very loud with extractor fan outside (backed into 46th st). Hairdryer and phone didn’t work. They need to sort out the older parts of hotel vs the new. Lobby hasent changed in 12 years! Only good thing is location!,2,Ruthie146,April 2019
606,Wonderful hotel,"Hotel is in an excellent position just off Times Square,very clean well kept and friendly staff throughout,would definitely recommend for all types of travelers.our room was high up with a great view of Times Square and the Hudson River ...fantastic.",5,nick t,April 2019
607,Great place with superb location,"The location of the hotel is great, it's in the middle of Timesquare. From restaurant to streetfood hawkers are at walking distance. Subway stations are also at walking distance. Hotel is quite nice and extremely busy all the time. Staff are friendly and pleasant. Rooms are quite big and well-maintained. Absolute value for money.",5,sanjuktaghosh,March 2019
608,Perfect location. Newly remodeled rooms.,"Very nice hotel right near Times Square. Beautiful, recently remodeled room. Very clean. Excellent shower. So quiet at night that we did not hear New York traffic. Friendly staff. I would stay at the Edison again.",5,Stay597632,April 2019
609,Hotel Edison,"Clean hotel, friendly staff, amazing location, as Time Square is practically on your doorstep!! And majority of sight seeing is maximum 20 minute walk away. Would recommend and definitely stay here again.",5,Cfrosties74,April 2019
610,"Great hotel, great staff!","Has been a great experience at Hotel Edison...we will stay here again!  And big shout  out to Bisere, the housekeeping manager.  What a terrific lady, very personable and helpful!  The location of hotel Edison is also fantastic if you want to be in the heart of the city.",5,Hatchel8,April 2019
611,Excellent location with great bar and restaurants!,"We booked this hotel on a whim and wanted a new hotel close to Times Square. When we first checked in they had messed up our rooms (2 junior suites). So they upgraded one of our party but this meant we were now on floors 11 and 20. Slight disappointment but this was made up by the manager giving us 10 breakfast vouchers where we could order anything off the menu and no limit! So we shared these vouchers with our friends and ended up going 3 times during our stay. So as a hotel, the facilities were excellent, staff too! We especially liked the bar and Gino made our night (bartender)!Slight downsides, hotel is being upgraded, so some disruption and some rooms look a bit tired but this didn’t put us off our trip as it was only being used for a room for the night. Other things were noise levels were high at night, so if you are planning on having an early night then don’t. Stay up later and have some fun!",5,David Walters,April 2019
612,Great Location,"The location was super close to all the action of Times Square. Right next to multiple Broadway shows. Staff was friendly and helpful. We did stay close to the elevator, that would he the only noise concern. There wasnt much street noise in our room considering how close we were to everything.",4,Compass55330827728,March 2019
613,Not a 4* room (the room we were allocated),"We recently travelled to New York to celebrate my wife's 50th birthday.The location of the hotel cannot be faulted - right by Times Square.  However, the room we stayed in (Classic) looked like it had not been decorated since the 1970's.  The window overlooking the parking lot rattled.After speaking to one of receptionists the following morning, we were promised a signature room the following day if we packed our cases and left them with the concierge for the day. We packed our cases that evening and before taking them downstairs the next day, went to check that the signature room had been allocated to us.  No-one was aware of what had been promised. So no move occurred.We were both really disappointed with the hotel overall; the concierge service had been outsourced and their lack of basic information about the cost of a taxi to the airport was non existent.We had a drink in the hotel bar on one of the evenings and after being told we were not able to sit at one of the stools at the bar due to a private function, we moved into the dining area.  One of the bar staff then shouted across to me asking me to walk across to the bar to sign the tab.  As a customer, I told him that if he wanted me to sign the tab, he could bring it over.  He told me he was too busy and the proceeded to shout across the bar asking for my name and room number. Totally unprofessional. Overall, great location but poor rooms and not great customer service.",2,Debbie C,March 2019
614,Never staying here again,"False advertising. Poor quality. Can hear everything that's happening in Times Square all hours of the day. Beds are uncomfortable, bathrooms feel like public restrooms. AC is loud. Internet is bad. Feels dirty.",1,GoPlaces39962141288,April 2019
615,Excellent location and service,"Check in and out were very quick and convenient. The staffs were very kind. The room was rather old but very clean. Un beatable location with every things (such as time square, m&m Hershy Disney stores, theaters, restaurants) handy",4,ginger t,April 2019
616,Very good,"The hotel is located on 47th Street and Seventh Avenue corner. A few steps away from Times Square. The hotel has a restaurant, an excellent café and bar. Also, three blocks (50th Street) there are 2 underground stations. With a red train you can reach the lower city and the Battery Park. From there you can sail In the second line, which is blue, there are three lines A, C, E. With the line E, you can reach Ground Zero. Blue lines A and C can be reached to Soho (station on Spring Street) And the Italian Quarter. Cafés and restaurants are located around the hotel.",5,4uyossi,March 2019
617,"Great location, below average room and service",Despite booking a twin share room we were given a queen room.  We were then told to line up again to have our room changed.  When we got to the room it was old and tired.  The service received from staff was poor - even one smile would have been welcomed.  Hotel is in a great location and would only recommend if you can get a room at a heavily discounted rate.,2,Andrew D,April 2019
618,"Great location, okay hotel, okay price.","Hotel Edison is an old hotel that's been nicely refurbished. Our room was small but the beds are comfy, bath could use a scrubbing and the Wi-Fi didn't work. BUT, the location is perfect for Broadway and Times Square! Decent hotel, decent price.",3,cathy r,April 2019
619,Great location but SO noisy!,"Having stayed in this hotel many years ago we were looking forward to our 3 night stay here this time. The location is fabulous, right next to Times Square and the staff were helpful enough (could possibly do with more reception staff). The lifts were always quick to access and the bedding and towels in the room were very clean and fresh. We had a classic room with 2 queen beds. The room was looking very tired, especially the bathroom and we were disappointed not to be provided with a kettle - just 2 bottles of water each day. However when I asked for a kettle at reception they did supply one so full marks for that! As our room was bang opposite the lifts I did fear that it might be noisy from other guests but in fact we didnt hear any noise from adjoining rooms or the lifts - THE SAME CANT BE SAID ABOUT THE OUTSIDE STREET NOISE!! The first night was noisy enough with sirens and general road noise but on the second night there was some road works being carried out right outside the front of the hotel and this loud constant noise continued throughout the whole night resulting in us not being able to get any sleep. Thankfully it was done by our third night so we just had the usual sirens and traffic noise etc. having stayed at the Salisbury hotel last time where our room included a microwave, fridge and kettle and was much much quieter, I would return to that hotel again whereas another visit to the Edison is off the cards! However, I cant dispute the great location.",3,Andrew D,April 2019
620,Jonathan L. to the rescue!,"I deeply appreciate the members of the Hotel Edisons staff who were involved in finding My Apple Phone , which I absent-mindedly left in the lobby's guest area.  Special thanks to Jonathan  Lopez for returning my phone.It was a happy ending to a wonderful and enjoyable visit to the theatre district. The entire Hotel Edison staff was friendly and , when necessary, helpful.",4,Alan S,April 2019
621,Great location and value ,First time in NY and we stayed 3 nights and the Edison. Check in wasn’t the best as they had no record of our booking as it seemed a common problem. I emailed twice and still no reply. The room on the 14 floor was ok. Clean but in need of upgrade. Ongoing upgrading of rooms is taking place. The bars on the hotel are always busy and classier than the hotel. The hotel in its day I’m sure was excellent but it’s a bit run down. On the positive side it’s about 40 yards to time square and broadway. So for first timers the location was brilliant. I would use it again as it’s well priced in an expensive city. Not luxurious but acceptable.,4,Dolphduncan,April 2019
622,Really shabby,We booked a Junior Suite with city views. When we arrived we were told we were being moved to a room with 2 queen beds but city views were not possible. The first room they took us to was to the 14th floor that was basically a building site. Plastic sheeting on the hallway carpet and over some of the room doorways. Thankfully they couldn’t get the door to open so they took us to a room on the 8th floor. But that was really shabby and had clearly not been vacuumed. Bathroom was grim and very dated. The staff weren’t overly helpful and I was disappointed with the standard of the accommodation. Would definitely not stay here in the future.,1,Michelle F,March 2019
623,Times Square home,"The Hotel Edison is our ""go to"" hotel in NYC. It's at Time Square in the theater district. Rooms are comfy and they take great care of their customers. They have queen size beds instead if double, which is rare in New York. Keurig coffee makers are in the room and they provide water bottles too! It's close to the subway and easy access to anywhere you need to go on the city.",5,mykidsmom_Atlanta,April 2019
624,Enjoyable experience,Great experience from beginning to start . Hotel staff was always delightful and helpful. Conveniency of the wonderful restaurants and cafe inside the hotel is ideal. Made our trip very fun and refreshing while  traveling the city. I recommend using Hotel Edison Guest Services Ambassadors(Demarcus and others ) for a more personable experience for hotel service rather than a third party website.  :),5,Dom D,April 2019
625,"Location, location, location!","Had another group at this hotel for several days.  As usual, it was a wonderful experience.  We had breakfast every morning in the hotel restaurant, and it was wonderful. They were so easy to work with.  I love staying at this hotel.  It is in the heart of Times Square/Broadway. Easy to get to theaters. There isn't anything negative about my experience with Hotel Edison.",5,fooded,March 2019
626,Recent Family Spring Break getaway,"The family was just here for family Spring Break trip and we had a Great time. From the moment we had check in with Christian and his great customer service to the moment we checked out. The Edison Happy hour on Tuesday & Friday evening was fun and relaxing. The person my family will remember most was Jonathan Lopez. Mr. Lopez in security, we were very lucky to have made contact with during our stay. Mr. Lopez was there every morning when we came down for breakfast he would great us with a smile and fist bumps for the Twins. He would also greet us with where is the Family going today? We would tell him and he would go on and on what to do there and more importantly help us get there the quickest.  Mr. Lopez was great and we look forward to coming back to Hotel Edison this family highly recommend this fine hotel with great location to everything in New York City.",5,Kevin R,March 2019
627,Great location near Times Square,"We have just returned from a 5 night stay and would definitely recommend. Choose a signature room as I believe they are the renovated rooms. Ours had plenty of room for a central NYC hotel, very comfy beds, we had room 927 which had a great view (see pic) Our room had a coffee maker, robes, toiletries and was cleaned every day. Half a block from Times Square (go early around 7am if you want to see it when it’s quiet) near to all the broadway shows and subway. Great central location.",5,TheLeonards2000,April 2019
628,Great location,"We had a great stay at Hotel Edison. The hotel is a half block from Times Square and a 5 minute walk from most of the theaters. Even though the hotel is older, it is very clean and safe. There is a security guard who checks that you have a key before you can get on the elevators. You can hear the traffic on 47th street, so bring a pair of ear plugs and you should be fine.",5,aputti,April 2019
629,Hotel Edison NYC,Just stayed at the Edison from 28th March to 1st April. Great hotel to stay at with great rooms and service. Perfect position right next to Times Square. If your planning a trip to New York I highly recommend this hotel for your stay. Enjoy.,5,mydogcharlie1,March 2019
630,Meh,"I spent last night at the Hotel Edison on a quick business trip. It’s pretty average. I was “upgraded” to a room on the 21st floor with a relatively spacious outdoor terrace.  I had to sign some  releases saying I wouldn’t throw things off the terrace etc. But unfortunately the door to the terrace was locked where I couldn’t open it, so that was a bust. The room was decent but not notable. Strangely there were no trashcans in the room. There were two recycling bins though. The shower was one of those that are becoming more and more popular, where the external wall is only about 2.5 feet wide, so water ends up going all over the bathroom. Room service was basically takeout from the restaurant in the lobby, meaning after you ordered it you had to go down and get it. Front desk and valet service was friendly but on the slow side.There were two big positives for most people. First, Location. The hotel is right off Times Square so if you are in town for tourism and theater you are well positioned. In my case my business meeting was right across the street from the hotel so that worked for me too. Second, Price.  This was a fairly inexpensive hotel for this part of town as near as I can tell.All said I probably wouldn’t stay here next time. I prefer places with a bit more character and off the beaten path.",3,Steve H,April 2019
631,Amazing Service - Great Location,Perfect location for going basically anywhere in NYC.Staff is incredible and accommodating. Concierge service was amazing - very knowledgeable and helpful giving suggestions.Highly recommend. Rooms need JUST a touch of TLC - a bit of chipping paint and wallpaper coming off the walls in some places - but bright rooms and enough space for what it's needed for. (NOT A TON),4,Ashley,March 2019
632,Exceptional Service,"At check-in, I asked for room upgrade. When I received my room #553, Queen Classic, one bed, I found it clean, but very small. I returned to the Front Desk.  While in line, I talked with De'Marco from Guest Relations.  We had a very warm and lively conversation about my visit to NYC.  I explained that I was excited about attending a show, but was disappointed with my room. I explained that I was in line to get a more up-to-the-minute status on a possible room upgrade.  Embarrassed because I had given The Edison, such high praise to my traveling companion based on my former visits, De'Marcus stated that he couldn't promise, but he would speak with his supervisor to see what he could do.  I said to myself, ""that was the right thing to do', but I did not expect a return call.To my delight, De'Marcus called me to inform that after speaking with his supervisor, Rommel, I was to be upgraded to a 2 queen bed Signature Room, at no extra cost.  I didn't believe it until I received my new keys from the front desk and visited my new room on the 21st floor. We had a large renovated room, 2 queen beds, a view of Times Square.  Now this is what I remembered from the Edison from back-in-the-day!  We also received a surprise bottle of wine, fruit, snacks and a warm note from De'Marcus!Thanks De'Marcus and Rommel!  It is good to know that exceptional service still exists at The Edison.  The Edison is blessed to have you, as Staff!  You're The BEST! Your efforts changed the entire tone of out trip.",5,popsdymond,March 2019
633,Great location for Broadway fans,I stayed at the Hotel Edison with family members the last week of March 2019. We had plans to see several Broadway shows and this hotel is well located in the theatre district. For Hamilton and Harry Potter fans those theaters are across the street. Our room was very clean with all needed amenities. Bottled water was supplied daily. The hotel was very secure and the staff very friendly and helpful. Even though it is just off Times Square our room was on the 10th floor which provided a sufficient noise buffer. We could easily walk or access the subway to all sites we were interested in seeing. The bathroom was on the small side but comparable to other metropolitan character hotels. We would definately stay at the Hotel Edison on a future New York visit!,4,VacationLover,March 2019
634,The best hotel in New York,"This is the best hotel in New York City stayed there a number of times and had a great experience. This is the best mangement team in New York, Scott and Danny. The staff from management to housekeeping to bellmen and doormen where fantastic and would do anything to make your stay unforgettable",5,James M,March 2019
635,Kind and Engaging Staff,"The kindness begins at the curb. The bellmen at the curb greet you with a smile and a big "" Welcome to The Hotel Edison!"" The desk staff are helpful and well organized. The new system they have with a line to check in seems to be operating more efficiently. You MUST show your room key to get on the elevators which has increased the safety at the hotel. My room was a spacious for NYC room with double queen beds AND A BATHTUB !(bathtubs are fast becoming a rarity in NYC) The housekeeping staff are WONDERFUL! I leave a daily note with what I would like and I have always been treated very well. (I do leave a daily tip, which I guess sadly has become a little shown kindness. I highly encourage everyone to always take a little extra care of those who take care of you) I have received many a kindness in return. This is my favorite place to stay in NYC. The location is in the very heart of the theater district and central to many other things as well.",5,Lynn H,March 2019
636,Extremely well located,This hotel it’s extremely well located in Times Square.Have a very good relation price/quality/services.Everything is client orientated and the expenses are well described at the bill.I recommend this hotel for sole travelers,4,Marado12,September 2018
637,Can't Be Beat,"I have been staying at the Hotel Edison for over 40 years.  The location is excellent.  The staff is extremely friendly, and the rate (for NYC) is very reasonable.  The rooms are small, but you're not in the middle of Times Square to stay inside the room! go...Go...GO!!!",5,Robert M,March 2019
638,Great location,"Sitting here now in lobby waiting for transfer home . Hotel is 1 minute to times sq & the red steps. Room was comfortable & clean as well of rest of hotel . Pleasant staff , a BIG thanks to Robbie in guest relations , an absolute great guy & so helpful 👏👏",5,buddy61,March 2019
639,Great Location and incredible staff!,"The location was great for exploring Times Square and visiting theaters for shows in the area. Beautiful views, very clean, comfortable rooms, and staff was super friendly. Would highly recommend this property to friends or family traveling to the city- it felt like we were getting lots of value for our money and it's definitely my first choice when I visit again.",5,Justin B,March 2019
640,"Clean Room, Great location","Stayed here for 5 nights.  The room was clean, small (which was what we expected).  We were on the 8th floor, and you could hear noise from the street, but we are used to using a sound machine, so that was not a big deal for us.This hotel is super close to time square.  Out the front door and to the left is where Waitress is currently showing, and out the back door is Hamilton.  This hotel is right in the middle of all the action.  On Friday and Tuesdays the hotel has a get together in the lobby area with free snacks and wine... it wasn't great, but it was free.We had booked through AMA, and thought all of the costs were accounted for... but we had to pay another $143 when we arrived.",3,Mickinley L,March 2019
641,Location superb!,"Just want to comment on the fantastic 3 night stay i had at Edison Hotel in New York last week. The location of this hotel could not be better and the security is A1. I was travelling on my own, female 50yr and felt 100% safe during my stay here. The rooms are small but that is normal for hotels in New York but they were perfectly proportioned and clean. Have already recommended to friends. You will not be disappointed. Thanks to everyone on a very well appointed and safe hotel. See you next time i come to the big apple!",5,LissieB123,March 2019
642,Beautiful Renovations while preserving their history,"It has been a few years since we have been in NYC. Every time we go, we always stay at the Edison Hotel, but the last time we were there, the rooms were starting to show age as well as wear and tear, but no more! Our room and bathroom were beautiful! If you want to see a Broadway show or be close to Times Square, this is the place to be. The history of the hotel is amazing and the Art Deco throughout the lobby and hotel is stunning. The Rum Room is so very cool and Friedman’s at the hotel has great food in a beautiful setting. They also have security right by the elevators, so you need to show your room key to have access to them. The front desk staff was great and very helpful as well.",5,Beth C,April 2019
643,Helpful customer seevice,"Thanks to Justina and Laura,I was able to check into my room quickly and efficiently.They were extremely helpful in a situation when it mattered. Good quality customer service is of great importance these days.",4,Mari M,March 2019
644,Cannot beat the location!,The Edison is steps from restaurants hotels and the Tix Booth at 47th and Broadway - as well as a convenient subway stop where you can buy your MetroCard.  Both of the in-house restaurants (Friedman's and Bond 45) are excellent.,5,Lorraine D,March 2019
645,Nice place to stay in Times Square,"Stayed here on recommendation of a friend and finding it as part of a deal on Travelocity. Stay here for the weekend on Mar 29-31. We arrived early in the day and were able to drop off the bags before the 3pm check-in. Room was small, but clean. A little warm and we could here some noise from Times Square at night after we got back in. Staff was nice. We visited Friedman’s- am attached restaurant while staying here. Good, not spectacular food. We really liked that we were so close to the shows we were seeing this weekend. All in all, a good stay. We would stay here again 👍",4,Bing C,March 2019
646,Big Apple over spring break!,"Totally enjoyed visiting NYC and Washington DC over spring break with out teenage son. This hotel is very classy, in the heart of Times Square, theatre district. ...minutes from Broadway. Lots of restaurants (Restaurant Row is great variety), Hell's kitchen great too. Our room was a little smaller than expected and the bathroom door was translucent which wasn't so great with a teenage son but we managed. The beds were super comfy and with the fan going at night, drowned out any street noise, we were on the 21st floor. Proximity to subway, 3 minutes. Great breakfast at the corner deli for a fraction of the cost compared to hotel food. Would recommend this place! There is a resort fee here too so don't be surprised. For 3 days we paid $87. Gym on 2nd floor, no pool.",5,blondiecalgary,March 2019
647,Convenient location but older hotel,"Location was right in the middle of Time Square, very convenient if your interests are shows and shoppong downtown. Room size is ok but facilities show their age. New York hotels are expensive, even old ones. Checking in was slow but staff is friendly and tried to help. Less noise from the street if you stay on higher floors, but you do hear police cruisers.",3,Ray L,March 2019
648,"Good location, poor room","We went to see Broadway shows. The Edison is perfectly located for this. The furthest theater was five blocks away. All the rest were much closer. However, the room was poorly maintained and not in good condition. I asked in advance for a room in the renovated section of the hotel, and did not get it. The heater in the room was so loud we could not have it on during the night. There were absolutely no grab bars in the shower. (No bath.) If you are only looking for Times Square location this hotel is OK. For comfort, look elsewhere.",3,JohnC301,March 2019
649,Weekend trip with family,"This is my second time staying at hotel Edison- the first time was in June 2010. I absolutely love this hotel and will continue to stay here every time I visit New York. It is located just around the corner from Times Square and blocks away from Central Park. The rooms have been updated since the last time I was there and they did a really nice job- looks modern but still has maintained the rich history and beautiful architecture from when it was first built. The staff is super friendly and very helpful! During my checkout I had a question about a charge and Skirt/Danny at the front desk not only explained it to me they also then removed some of the charges as a courtesy! Additionally Robbie, the guest relations ambassador, spent a good amount of time explaining the history of the hotel to my mother and daughter while I checked out- he also gave my daughter a little Edison bear that she loves. Overall very satisfied with both my stays and will be coming back many more times!",5,Savygirl,March 2019
650,noisy heating system,Awful heating system wakes you up every few hours when it turns on. Like having a car in the bedroom . Very dated decor. Only good thing is the location right on Broadway great for shows. Expensive bar.,2,eddieprice13,February 2019
651,Excellent location,We enjoyed the fact that it was handy for Broadway shows and the Hop on Hop off bus. The room was small but adequate and the bathroom had a bath/shower. We didn’t visit the restaurant as we preferred to go somewhere more local.,4,JanS365,March 2019
652,Great location and service,My family stayed in this hotel while visiting NYC.  It is a great location to experience the energy of Time Square.  We were there to show our kids the sights and this hotel put us within walking distance to almost everything we wanted to do.  The room was a good size and the staff was very friendly and helpful!,5,eaglesnc,March 2019
653,"Great Hotel, excellent location","Hotel was very well situated on Times Square, with good access to transport, including to subway and mainline stations, restaurants, coffee shops, etc. We booked a “Signature King” room which was modern, had a comfortable bed and a large wall-mounted TV with access to multiple channels and on-demand movies. Room was very clean, air-conditioning and heater was very easy to use and efficient. All expected conveniences were available including: Free (in-room) WIFI, Iron & board, coffee/tea maker, hair dryer, room safe, slippers & gown, shower cap, etc. Bathroom was clean, all facilities easy-to-use, including hot power shower. If you are planning to use one of the tour buses to see NYC then I recommend “Top View” Tours as the stop for this is on the back entrance (46th Street) to Hotel Edison. We had planned a very-late check-in (at 3am!) which hotel staff happily accommodated. We will stay here again when back in NYC.",4,Anjam S,March 2019
654,Very bad customer service - no communication - money taken without authorisation,We were excited to stay at the Edison but we have now had to cancel our reservation due to the Edison hotel taking close to £300 from my account without any authorisation.  I have tried to contact the hotel a number of times and they fail to respond.  Very sad by this experience. :(,1,castlerockscornwall,September 2018
655,Never disappoints,"I needed to stay in NYC for a few nights for business and stayed at the Edison. Convenient location, super comfortable rooms and extremely helpful staff. Despite that it is located in a busy are of NYC it was very quiet and I thoroughly enjoyed my stay.",5,allenlefkowitz,March 2019
656,Amazing stay with exceptional staff,"We recently stayed at the Edison in January and as always your hoping the hotel you choose to stay in is good. This was more than good, from the minute we arrived we where welcomed with open arms by the wonderful staff at reception. For the amount of time you spend in the hotel room I was delighted with the refurbished room we got. As it was our honeymoon they left us a little gift in our room which was quite nice of them. I’ve booked to go back to NY in Jan 20’ and I’ve picked the Edison again. The location is right on Times Square (who wouldn’t love that!!!). I’ve been in contact recently about our future stay with Christina and I must say, the Edison best be very proud of this staff member she’s been very helpful and had a lot of time to deal with my queries. Can’t wait to go back!! Don’t think twice about booking here, book it!! Believe me you will not regret it.",5,Martin,January 2019
657,Great location.,"Stayed last week nice enough hotel great location, staff friendly and helpful enough could be alittle better (3.5 out of 5). Hotel has a lovely bar and nice looking restaurant/breakfast room although we never used it. Room was ok again alittle smaller than we expected from our previous USA visits and could do with revamping but overall we enjoyed our stay.",3,Derek F,March 2019
658,Great experience,"Location was excellent. They have happy hour on Tuesday and Friday nights. The hors d'oeuvres were very good and wine was excellent. The entertainment was superb! The staff at the hotel were pleasant and efficient, especially the hospitality hostess!",5,travelers760,March 2019
659,"Delightfully friendly staff, a rich ambiance, and great location","We had a great experience at the Hotel Edison.  The staff were superb, especially Tex at check-in.  A King of hospitality, he made us feel very welcome!  The housekeeping team was delightfully friendly, as well as accommodating and thorough - really a great crew.The design, the murals, the overall décor creates a rich ambiance that I loved.Of course the location is superb as well.I very much recommend this hotel.",5,Matt N,March 2019
660,Fehat assisted us with our bags on the day we arrived as well as the day we left. He was so nice and personable.,"Fehat who assisted us was great.  I am giving the hotel a 5 star simply for Fehat. We had 3 rooms and 7 people in our party. The rooms were old, wallpaper coming off the walls and a big hole in the bathroom door (room 415) The bathrooms were extremely tiny. The tub was stained a brownish color. The floors were nasty. Again - the staff was friendly. EVERY NIGHT we were there, the air conditioner unit rattled and banged alot. It was super loud. I complained about it twice. We were given 3 breakfast vouchers and still dealt with the noise.",5,Angela Haynes,March 2019
661,Such a wonderful experience,"For Spring Break My Boyfriend and I Enjoyed our vacation at the Hotel Edison! Service was excellent ! De’Marcus was delightful, made us feel right at home . He also made sure we had everything we needed and made the check in and out process painless . I truly loved the hotel security, being able to know no one will be able to go on the elevator without showing their keys was a huge life saver! we met Francis (security guard) he helped us navigate around Time Square. Also Francis reinsured us that everyone is on high alert . Our experience was a great one ! We will come back soon !",5,Taylor H,March 2019
662,Comfortable Hotel in Great Location,"Spartan room but comfortable bed, good lighting, bath with new fixtures.Housekeeping services excellent. Kudos to housekeeper Maria Tavera for superb service. Free refrigerator just provided on request.",4,SONDRARTRACY,March 2019
663,Loved It!,"We were going in to see Hamilton & decided to stay over, could not beat Hotel Edison, it is right across the street from the Richard Rogers Theater. It was freezing on our Wednesday night, so we sat in the lobby until it was showtime. For us it was THE perfect location.The hotel staff was very helpful & friendly, felt very secure, as the staff made sure no one got in the elevators without showing their key card. Looks like they are undergoing renovations, other than there being no pictures on the wall, everything else looked newly redone. Beds comfortable, plenty of towels, even a complementary bottle of water. The hotel itself was quiet, however there was street noise, afterall you are staying in the city that doesn't sleep!There is a restaurant & a bar on the premises. Would absolutely stay here again.",4,Kitsaattheshore,March 2019
664,Exceptional staff! Always willing to go above and beyond!,"My daughter and I stayed at the Hotel Edison for 4 nights. The staff was always friendly and helpful! The desk staff were helpful, security was always paying attention in the busy lobby which made me comfortable knowing people in the hallways had a reason to be there, not random strangers.  When I returned home and realized I left something valuable behind I called and Alan and Danny, who went the extra mile to locate my possesion(s) and get them back to me. Would highly recommend this hotel! Thank you everyone!Joe Cicio",5,Joe Cicio,March 2019
665,Edison hotel fabulous,"First time in New York and it was with a sense of hope that the hotel description would not disappoint ... and it most certainly did not - the Edison is in a prime location to time square and broadway walkable to most attractions and places of interest - Staff were friendly approachable and helpful . Good security : Rooms whilst sparse were clean and airy fresh water daily - the hotel houses two restaurants bonds and Fredrick both fabulous - friendly attentative staff, a wide range of foods and beverages with a lovely atmosphere - had a fabulous time and would recommend for the traveler who wants to be in the hub of the big Apple and feel comfortable -",5,jusjane12,March 2019
666,The Edison Hotel Official Review,"The hotel is very well located, just a couple blocks away from Time Square, which is in midtown, Manhattan. The front desk works fine, and we were welcomed by Christine -who works on Guest Relations- and she was extremely friendly and answered all of our questions clearly. Thus we highly recommend the Edison Hotel in NYC. :)",5,Kyle Lee,March 2019
667,Good location,"Location is good. The hotel is close to Time-SQ. The lobby is cozy. There are many lights, so the lobby-space is illuminated. The artwork in the lobby is awesome. Christine from guest relations is friendly and polite.",4,sbnmp,March 2019
668,Good Staff,"The staff’s name Cristinne show us the hotel lobby give us a lot of information about the history of the hotel also she give us a little present, that was a nice gesture. The hotel has really nice pictures about the history of Times Square, also the famous stairs of the movie “The Godfather” and a bar called “The Rum House”. Perfect location, near to broadway theater and Times Square.",4,TavoCanosa,March 2019
669,Fabulous hotel fabulous location fabulous everything,"I stay at hotels a lot, like pretty much every week. So I know hotels!This place is fabulous! It’s Art Deco style is so beautiful.The staff there are super friendly and the location is second to none - so many places to visits and within walking distance to many of them.The breaksfast place next door serves lovely food and I recommend the avocado and scrambled eggs on toast :-) and the coffee!The Italian Restaurant couple of doors down as you turn left out of the hotel is highly recommended. We went there twice for dinner and the food is amazing.Andrews coffee shop on 7 th and around 37th - is also recommended, esoaecially if you like that old diner style.Love this hotel and definitely will be back again.I had follow up from the hotel manager thanking me for staying and that to me is great customer service.Thank you Edison for making my stay so enjoyable.Tess Towmsend",5,Tess,March 2019
670,Valuable Stay in great location,The staff were really friendly and the hotel has cool artwork and an old school vibe. The location is perfect because you can get anywhere in Manhattan easily from there. Christine and Rommel from Guest Relations were very helpful and went out of their way to help us.,5,Autumn G,March 2019
671,Great Location,It was the perfect location for a Time Square visit.  The front desk staff extremely nice. The rooms were average to the small size.  Rooms were very clean and the bathroom was imaculate. Plenty to do around the area.,4,David G,March 2019
672,Hotel with a heart!,"We love this hotel and would not stay anywhere else in New York. It is so well placed for shopping, dining and attractions. One minute from Times Square and all that has to offer. The staff are exceptional from doormen to front desk to housekeeping. They also have hotel ambassadors who are there just to take care of your needs and advise where to go and what to do. We found Robert to be outstanding and so courteous. The beds and bedding are so very comfortable too!",5,rustypaws,March 2019
673,Great hotel and great location!,I have used this hotel for the last 5 years for a trip with students. It is an ideal location with Time Square right around the corner and theaters in the immediate area. The two restaurants in the hotel are nice when it's raining or inclement weather.,5,Rachael,March 2019
674,Great hotel and great staff,"The Hotel Edison Times Square was a great place to stay.  The rooms were clean with lots of closet space.  The people there were very friendly and helpful.  The added security of checking your hotel key before being able to go on the elevators was a great comfort. (I don't know if it is always this way, or because there were groups of students staying at the hotel - but it was nice to have it in place). The lobby is nice and comfortable.  The hotel is in a great location for going to Times Square, and just getting around to lots of places.  The staff was particularly helpful when my daughter left something in the room. The head of security, Jonathan, went above and beyond in helping to find the item and get it a special box and wrap it so that it would not be damaged.  It arrived in great condition.  He was so helpful and courteous during the whole process and always kept us informed of what was happening.  I would definitely recommend the Hotel Edison Times Square.",5,Jenny R S,March 2019
675,amazing,"we were in new york for vision expo, and this was the first time staying here!!! the staff was great, the most helpful and friendliest person was Daniel (Danny) O'brien!!!! he was very friendly told us about the restaurant bond 45, again amazing!! Told us where to shop, then checked on us!!! i would recommend this hotel to everyone, and if you need help ask for danny!!!!",5,Tanya M,March 2019
676,I LOVE THE EDISON,"Great location on times square.  Staff is so friendly and helpful.  Love the decor in the lobby, you must take time to hang out and enjoy the art.  Has restaurants and the Rum Bar attached that you can enter from inside.  I have stayed here two different times and loved it.",5,Shelly T,March 2019
677,"Great location, great staff, not so great reservation experience","I don't travel much to NYC and so i don't have a lot to compare to in this city. We met family members traveling from overseas for the weekend, and asked to put on their floor. The desk clerk, Juan, was extremely helpful, and courteous, and got us hooked up very quickly, and our room was ready when we returned hours later, We were in a room around back of the elevator bank. It was quiet, had windows overlooking 46th street, but the room was very oddly configured - a long hallway to an area with the bed (queen) with built in night tables (standard hotel type bed these days) and not much else. No fridge in the room no dresser in the room. Small table with coffee maker and lamp.  Spartan, but comfortable. For an average of 250 dollars a night this 'upgrade' room might have a dresser, but the closet had enough hangars for our clothing. Again , even for behind the elevator bank it was silent, no machine noise nor elevator noise at all. If this was an upgrade (i think due to the floor, i'd not be anxious to see what we originally were given based on the price paid.The staff was extremely helpful and courteous throughout, the security to get to the elevator bank was effective, and the doorman very knowledgable in helping us with cabs, and directions for various places. In all it was a good time, thought i do not think so much a good value. Our family members stayed in a different room on the same floor, much nicer, a little more spacious with a king bed, and they paid less for it. I'd certainly stay here again, and the location is really great, I'd shop more closely for the 'best deal' as neither the 3rd part booking company we used for one reservation nor the hotel directly actually lived up to their commitments regarding changes. Beware also that all NYC hotels now have a generally hard-to-find or read 'resort fee' or 'facilities fee' that adds from 35 to 75 dollars per day to your cost. This seems to be the case throughout so the advertised price can be competitive, but in the end you pay a pretty big fee per night. The fee here was 57 dollars and change.",4,Martin B,March 2019
678,Fantastic Location & extremely friendly & efficient staff,"If you are looking for a base in the heart of manhattan, the Edison hotel is your hotel. We stayed here last week & couldn't fault the extreme efficiency & helpfulness of the staff. Danny & Melissa at the front reception were very customer orientated & assisted us with our check out. Our room was extremely comfortable & serviced daily by the very diligent room service staff. I would definitely recommend this hotel.",4,Breege D,March 2019
679,1st Time in New York,"The best thing about this hotel is the location - a literal 30 second walk out of the front door and you are in Times Square!! The staff were really friendly from the time we checked in until the time we checked out (Justina on reception was great on checkout helping us with our change). The room we stayed in was clean and there were complimentary soaps, creams etc. in the bathroom also, the water bottles being refreshed on a daily basis was a great touch. The bar and the restaurant were good with a varied selection of food and drinks available. The only negative point was the concierge service - I asked a question about the Statue of Liberty and Staten Island ferries and the two people on the desk at the time didn't even bother to answer my question and just pointed at leaflets.Overall, this hotel is great and I would definitely recommend it to anyone staying in New York.",5,Anthony Evans,March 2019
680,2nd visit ,"Lovely hotel with lots of charm, this is my second stay here and will not be the last. Location of the hotel couldn’t be any better if you tried, a lot of hotels advertise being in Times Square but this actually is! The rooms have been updated since my last visit,but the hotel hasn’t lost it’s oldy worldy character. The restaurant downstairs serves delicious breakfasts although it’s a bit pricey. We will definitely be back.",5,etremat,July 2018
681,Winter Show Trip,"We stayed at the Hotel Edison in late February in order to see a bunch of Broadway shows and do some sightseeing in NYC. The Staff was wonderful, especially Melissa, who did everything possible to make this a great stay. The security was reassuring, the rooms were very clean and comfortable, and the location was outstanding. This is an older hotel, well worn, but maintained nicely. Has character and history on its side.",4,Ron,February 2019
682,Location Location Location ,You can’t get more convenient for all the attractions New York has toffee than to be in the heart of Times Square.  The Bond 45 Restaurant and Lounge is in house accessible and excellent.  The Subway is a couple hundred steps from the door and thaw Tkts booth is even closer!,5,ChsTravelers,March 2019
683,Nice hotel ,"We stayed there in February for three nights and had a very good stay. The staff was extremely nice and helpful, the room very clean and comfortable that I regretted that I stayed in this area around times square, which I don’t like very much. That’s not the hotels fault though :-) another time I will stay downtown",4,Jesper B,March 2019
684,Great Assistant Manager Jenny,"I came and stayed with my friend at The Edison for a high school mini girls reunion. My friend picked this hotel as she has stayed here over 20 times. But this time the room on 6th floor was terrible. Very worn out. The shower was missing a lot of its finish and carpet was terrible. When speaking to Asst Mgr Jenny Fonseca she was amazing about the quality of the room.  She couldn’t have been more understanding. Gave us breakfast free vouchers , and a discount on the room. Please applaud her ! Make sure to get the signature room and you won’t have a problem!",4,CaraZimm,March 2019
685,CENTRAL ACCOMODATION IN TIMES SQUARE,"I recently stayed at this hotel and was impressed with the service I received from all the staff and security.The room was basic but very comfortable, and the Friedmans Restaurant serve a very healthy cuisine which consists of Gluten and fat free items and the best coffee I have tasted! Close to all the Broadway Theatres and within walking distance of all the sights and especially Times Square.",5,ThorntonProductions,September 2018
686,"My second stay here, we love the ambiance, the location and the friendly staff.","Let's be real, staying in the theatre district in NYC is going to be expensive.  I found the Edison is a great value for all you get.  The hustle and bustle as soon as you walk out the door, the great lobby with all the people and Tues/Fri wine and pupus nights, Time Square is RIGHT THERE!!  And yes, the wifi can be a little wonky, but the same thing happened at another hotel I was at down the street, so maybe that is just what it's like. I have stayed twice, the second time we moved to the Edison after one night at another hotel because I wanted the feel that we got from the Edison. The staff was always super helpful, I like the idea of security at the elevators, the beds were SUPER comfortable. We won't stay anywhere else from now on!",4,X8122YHsueg,March 2019
687,Horrendous room really aweful,"My husband booked a room for our wedding anniversary on hotels.com.  Room looked nothing like picture, it was entirely taken up by the bed - you literally could barely walk around bed.  Bathroom had peeling paint and was just large enough for toilet tiny sink and dated tub.  He asked for a better room and had to pay another 80 for a marginally better room.  No one was friendly.  Would never ever go back!",1,L8516PJjenniferk,March 2019
688,Vacation,The free wifi doesn’t work at all!! The room services are good. Convenience location! Noisy at night due to reversing vehicles. hotel interior old and needs refurising. Security is adaquently station at lift lobby. Recommended for short stay.,3,Ronnie L,March 2019
689,Not as good as advertised,"Slightly below average. Bathroom fittings are old, with the aged bathtub paint peeling off. WiFi is not good, laptop unable to surf websites with lots of security warnings. No mini bar fridge. Room warm/cold air conditioner runs noisy like a generator, impossible to sleep with all that motor noise cutting in and out throughout the night. Closet was average. Totally no coffee machine at all! Concierge charges USD1 per item for temporary luggage storage. For that price, my guess there are better valued accomodations nearby within this theater district.",2,hyeel,March 2019
690,Unbelievably Rude,"We came to this hotel for a family short break and from the minute we landed at JFK, the rudeness began.We booked a transfer through the hotel booking system to arrive with nobody there to pick us up. We rang the hotel who told us to just get a taxi as they had no details and it wasn’t their problem.Upon arriving at the hotel, the rudeness continued, we booked a very high standard of room and the level of customer service was so poor I actually could t believe it. For some reason people that work hear seem to think they are a cut above when they really aren’t.Everything is a problem and one that they are not willing to deal with.Honestly too many issues to mention.I can honestly say this hotel has made me never want to return to New York and would never recommend this hotel to anyone.Really really disappointed with the entire experience with the hotel.",1,Laked003,March 2019
691,Helpful receptionist,"Excellent placement near Times Square. Clean and spacious room. I was a bit shocked when the bill from the hotel was much higher than what I got at Hotels.com, but Justina at the reception helped with a smile and gave me the price Hotels.com had announced. Thanks! Advice: check for extra fees if you book through an internet agent, and read the text hidden at the bottom of the page...",4,Tomas D,March 2019
692,Excellent staff,"Hotel Edison is in a great location right on time square Rooms not a bad size, clean staff very friendly and helpful hotel bar nice and restaurant nice and not to expensive can be a bit noisy at night",5,Alfie K,February 2019
693,Mr Sean Mckendrick ,Had an amazing St Patrick’s Day weekend in New York I cannot day enough good things about the Hotel Edison. It’s an older Hotel with a lot of character. Very centrally located to everything & friendly staff. I had a small issue with my room last year when I stayed here but decided to give it another shot & I’m so happy I did.,5,Sean M,March 2019
694,Fantastic service.  Great location.  Happiness stops there.,"Our room was not terribly clean. The shower tiles on the floor and wall had mildew. My bigger complaint, however, were the PAPER THIN walls and the amount of noise made by cleaning staff.  We arrived on a Sunday afternoon. Monday morning, bright and early - and I do mean, early - cleaning staff were at it, taking no effort to quietly close room doors each time they entered to change a towel or a sheet.  Instead of propping the door open, the cleaning staff would allow the security door mechanism to slam the door closed each time. I would venture a guess that each room cleaning garnered 5 or 10 jarring door slams.  Worse yet, my room was next door to the utility closet which also had a security latch, so I got double the trouble.  After about an hour, I emerged and asked the cleaning staff to be quieter.  Not so much.  Then there was loud talking among the cleaning staff in the hallway, not in a whisper but in full tone and at times, shouting.  The noise was incessant.  The put the cherry on the top, the cleaning staff whipped out an industrial hall carpet cleaning machine and started operating it at around 8:30 a.m.  Sounded like a freight train. Now all of this would be fine for a business guest hitting the road at 7:00 a.m., but I was on Spring Break, and had hoped to sleep in at least until 9.  Regardless, I pay for a so I can sleep there and shouldn't be expected to be up at the break of dawn for the cleaning staff's convenience. That message appears to have been wholly lost.  Won't be back.",3,Allison B,March 2019
695,Excellent staff - Robbie took good care of us!,"My husband and I stayed only one night during a quick stopover.  First time at the Edison. (We usually stay in TriBeCa). We met concierge Robbie as we checked in, and he was very attentive and helpful despite our short stay.  We looked for him later to say Thank$, but never found him. The room was fine.  Very reasonable room rates for NYC.",5,Jim P,March 2019
696,A must book,"We booked this hotel to replace the booking we had with the Manhattan at times square. We rebooted due to seeing awful reviews of the first hotel. We are so glad we booked the hotel Edison. Staff were friendly and helpful. We had a signature room, the bed is lush and the shower was to die for. A handy safe located in the wardrobe for valuables. The location is top notch. It's literally a 5 minute walk if that to the Times square. We didn't eat in bond 45, but the jazz house was fantastic and there are plenty of places to eat and drink in the close proximity. Do not hesitate to book.",5,claireportik,March 2019
697,NYC holiday,"Highly recommend central to everything great staff great rooms could not fault this hotel in any way , staff where great it was child friendly the evening music was great and they made the best pancakes",5,ebyrne74,March 2019
698,Great location,"The location is fantastic - so close to Times Square, and convenient for the tourist bus routes. We walked to Central Park from the hotel as well. The hotel, although an older style, has plenty of character and charm. Our room was spacious and the only downside was the lack of plugs!",4,Michelle S,April 2018
699,Great Location,"This is an older hotel with lots of charm. They have and are still doing upgrades to the property. The staff is amazing and very helpful. The location is the main reason for the stay, it is in the perfect location. So close to times square (a 1 minute walk) but not in the middle as to disturb sleep. Would stay again.",5,Sheridan G,March 2019
700,"Great location, clean rooms",We stayed at the Edison this past weekend and will go back the next time we are visiting NYC. Great location for a reasonable price. We were located right next to time square and very close to Broadway theatres. The rooms were clean and fairly spacious for NYC.,5,stacey m,March 2019
701,Best Hotel in NYC!,My friends and I were there 5 nights.  Great service!  All the staff had smiles on their faces.  And the location?  Right in the heart of Times Square!  Felt safe and secure.  Everything within walking distance.  Couldn't ask for more.  I stay here every year and look forward to next time!,5,Janice B,March 2019
702,OLD AND DIRTY,Don’t dare arriving a few minutes before 3pm. Waited 48min to checkin. Room “not ready” made me pay to keep my suitcase while the wait. Went back at 3:15 waited another 35min to get the keys. Was supoose tonget a 20square meter room got an old very dirty and maybe 8 square meter. When i went back to see the reception they told me never reserve with a third party “Expedia” as the try tonsell and dont tell the truth!!!!! Bravo Edison how can you point someone else and especially Expedia who is your biggest customer!!!!VERY WELL SITUATED BUT NOTHING SPECIAL FOR THE REST !!!!! VERY DESSAPOINTED.,1,Steve929,March 2019
703,"Good Service, Safe & Clean Hotel in a Great Location","The Edison is an older hotel but they have made a big effort to make it a very comfortable place to stay:  very safe, very quiet and very comfortable beds, great service, nice lobby with amenities, fantastic gym open 24 hours and decent business centre open 24 hours.  There were a couple of problems with the heating & wifi in my room but someone was sent immediately to correct the problem.",4,H0lidayMEL,March 2019
704,My New York Experience at Hotel Edison Times Square,"My husband and I spent five wonderful, funfilled days and nights in New York City and we chose the Hotel Edison for our accomodations.  We are yearly visitors of the hotel and really enjoy the service amenities and location.  This year was especially memorable and exciting because of the wonderful people like Mr. De Marcus Woods, Mr. Robert Moss and all of the guest relations ambassadors and staff who went above and beyond to make our stay pleasant and memorable.  The attention provided throughout our stay was one that we will soon not forget.  The hotel room was quit comfortable, large and clean.  Everyone at the hotel were very personable as well as professional and went out of their way to make sure that we were happy and comfortable.  I would also like to give a special shout out to guest relations ambassadors for the wonderful Happy Hour every Tuesday and Friday.  I believe that is a very good way to welcome guest to the hotel.  The foods, entertainment and ambience were nicely planned.  Thank you again to Mr. DeMarcus Woods and the rest of the guest relations staff for making our trip to New York the best ever.Marsha JosephHouston, Texas",5,Marsha J,March 2019
705,Perfect Choice!,I would recommend this hotel to anyone!It was our first time in New York City!  Hotel Edison was the Perfect Choice! Right from the moment we checked in ALL the staff were quick with a smile and a greeting.The added security at the elevators was a great comfort.  Friends of ours stayed in another hotel a couple blocks away and we walked all over their hotel and never once were stopped to make sure were guests there.Our room was perfect.  We were in a recently renovated room.  Very clean with complimentary water and coffee.I knew at the time of booking the hotel was under construction but you would never have known.  The crew was very considerate with their working hours - and incredibly polite!Edison Hour was a nice added bonus :),5,Roach,March 2019
706,Look no further,"The Hotel Edison exceeded our expectations and we will definitely be returning!  Rooms extremely clean, close proximity to Times Square, felt very safe, and for NY standards- was very affordable.  The staff made sure our stay was complete with complimentary coffee and water bottles daily for each room.  With all the hotel options in the big apple, look no further.",5,Lee W,March 2019
707,Superb Staff,"This large hotel seems to specialize in tour groups and does so very well. The staff was exceptional.  I had a couple of heating/cooling issues,initially, but they were solved during the first evening with an offer of more blankets, a visit from maintenance, an offer of a space heater.  They were all helpful as they worked to solve the problem.  On a note of safety, my room was once automatically locked because they didn't have the right credit card on file...and so when I charged a breakfast to my room, it didn't go through.  For very good reasons, my door was then blocked until I could prove my identity.  Another wonderful procedure of this hotel was that we always had to show our room key card prior to moving to the elevators.  I have been to a lot of hotels, including others in NYC, but none have required that ID.  A very good idea!!  And the had a bank of about 6 elevators and always a staff member to move us onto one.  Even when 100 people were waiting at the same time for the elevator, he only took a couple of minutes to move thru the line.  Very fast. Very efficient.  The front desk managers, Ben and Steve; the IT staff member who helped me in the business center, Jonathon and Anita by the elevators, and other staff were amazingly helpful, polite and kind. Christine Lin of Guest Relations responded within a very short time to the survey which the hotel asked me to complete.  At any given time, one could see 10-15 staff members greeting and helping guests. Even one time because I forgot to remove the 'do not disturb' door hanger, my room was not cleaned but they came later in the day even so!!  More than was expected, for sure!! As is often the case in older hotels, the room was small, but for one person was fine--wi-fi, a comfortable queen bed, nice shower, work desk, TV, coffee and water, a safe if needed and the usual amenities. I was not wild about having to pay for wi-fi in the business center, however.  Very nice lobby, artwork, a cafe, and an attached restaurant, Bond45, was excellent.",5,Kathy,March 2019
708,Extra Mile,We left some items behind and Jonathan Bracero (security) secured our items and shipped them to us.  Amazing response and customer service.  Communication was superior and appreciated the extra effort to take care of this for us!,5,LMM,February 2019
709,Late Birthday Treat,"The location is amazing Steps away from time square.Very busy at check-in. Room was not the refurbished one but clean and warm.Towels and bed linen changed whenever requested.Bond 45 restaurant in hotel is good value .Rum bar excellent entertainment.Staff very helpful whenever reproached. Security in lobby very good,really enjoyed my stay thank you",4,seaboy1,March 2019
710,Nice staff but room was dated ,The room was very dated and especially the bedroom. For the price we paid it was not acceptable  then after 5 nights we got presented with the resort fee of $150. Most hotels include this in the booking price so it was a shock to us. Our room was extremely cold and the heating didnt work. So overall I would not stay again.,1,Nici D,March 2019
711,One week,"We've had a great time! The hotel has a great staff, clean room (thank you Hemlatta, great neat kept room) location is perfect, close to Times Square. You feel welcome and like home away from home. I can highly recommend to come here.",4,LisbethKSwe,March 2019
712,Good service and good location,"The lobby is very busy, but everyone is helpful and friendly.  Good security and excellent location.

715,"Good Location, meh hotel..","So as a travel agent, I was really pissed off when we got to our room and the bathroom was smaller then a child’s closet. The pictures that show the “Signature Room” look more like the “Classic Room” they state they have. But in my eyes they all looked the same to me after switching rooms and seeing not much of a difference. When I went downstairs to talk to someone about the mistake the front desk staff were rude and unfriendly. You’d think a travel agent would be treated well as I have clients that I can recommend coming back here. Unfortunately my experience wasn’t great and I won’t be telling my clients about this hotel if they are wanting to book a New York trip. If I had to pick some positives for this hotel it would be that it was in a great and amazing location, walking distance from Times Square and historic sites! I also really enjoyed the restaurant  Friedman’s that they had just next to the lobby!",2,travelingchick95,February 2019
716,Very helpful,"I was having an issue with my bill. Since I booked through an outside agency, additional fees were charged upon check in. Unfortunately I was having trouble getting reimbursed.

718,"Flawless, 5 Star service ","Firstly this is the third stay at this hotel in as many years! We arrived afternoon and checked in hassle free and quickly, we were shown our room 1812 and I was very impressed! The room was spotlessly clean and modern with all the extras, coffee machine, water, robes and slippers ironing board two TVs and iron ect!So close to Times Square and rockerfeller centre 5th Ave!Mr Rommel Gopez and his team at guest relations really do go the extra mile to ensure you have an amazing stay, he arranged for us to have a late check out as we weren’t getting collected until 1500hrs on the last day!The managers reception is a great way to network and meet fellow guests and enjoy the great lobby in the hotel.Some may find my review too good, but ask yourself this, if this hotel wasn’t all I said and more would I have gone back to the same place in the last three years?Thanks again Rommel and team and I definitely will see you all again very soon.Best regards Craig Henaghan.",5,Craig Henaghan,March 2019
719,Family of 5?  Fantastic Hotel!,"My family (my husband, daughters ages 16,14,11 and me) just returned from staying at the Hotel Edison.  Our signature family suite had two rooms- one with a king sized bed and another with two queen sized beds.The rooms were beautiful, comfortable and clean.  Amazing location too.Rooms for a family of 5 are hard to find and the Hotel Edison exceeded our expectations.  Bonus- our teenagers were thrilled to stay in a true NYC hotel, not a generic usual that fits 5.",5,Stephanie M,March 2019
720,One star,"I am suspect that reviews are real for this hotel. First room was filled w mold and terrible peeling paint. We were immediately given a new room without question but next room was only slightly better. Furniture looks from 1940s, wouldn’t put my clothes in a dresser or step on floor in bare feet. This was my 1st time in NYC and didn’t have time or inclination to move because you clearly can’t trust reviews anymore . 2nd room door looked like someone had previously attempted to break in, poor lock on door.",1,Karen S,March 2019
721,Thank You!,"Thank you Christian and Eric for getting us settled quickly after a long day of travel from Vienna, Austria. Highly recommend the staff here and we’ll stay here again the next time we return to New York City!",5,Mobile792996,March 2019

724,Another great stay at the Hotel Edison!,"My friends and I wouldn’t think about staying at another hotel in Times Square! We look forward to our annual New York City trip and seeing the friends we’ve made who work at the Edison. Danny O’Brien greeted us when we arrived and made sure we were comfortable with our rooms, recommended the hotel restaurants and assisted us at checkout. Look forward to seeing you next year....Thank you!",5,scgranny007,March 2019
725,"Lovely hotel, great location.","Location so close to Times Square and in the heart of the hustle and bustle, but quite peaceful at night. Currently being refurbished, we got a room on the newly refurbished floor, room was lovely, really retro decor, very clean. Towels and bed linen changed whenever requested, water and coffee/tea machine in room were a lovely touch. Cleaning staff and security so polite and friendly. Encountered a couple of front desk staff lacking in our standard of customer service skills, but it did not ruin the experience, (we encountered quite a lot of this during our stay in other establishments!) Would recommend staying here. Restaurant and bar within the hotel too, and within walking distance to a lot of places around Manhattan and subway stations.",4,Lucy W,March 2019
726,Sevdija was incredibly helpful and kind!,Sevdija was the staff person responsible for preparing our room each day. She was always incredibly cheerful and friendly.

728,Best Broadway Hotel experience !!!,"Hotel Edison is the perfect place to stay if you want access to Broadway and Restaurant Row.  My daughter and I spend one night at Hotel Edison and we wouldn't have changed a thing.  The level of service from valet parking, to front desk, to Cafe Friedman staff is exceptional.  I will not stay anywhere else for Broadway shows ! Thanks you Hotel Edison !",5,Jennifer C,March 2019
729,Very Nice Hotel and Great Location,"We booked a renovated suite and were in room 2109. We had 3 windows, a separate King bedroom, and a living area with a fold out sofa bed. Each room had a TV. The room was clean and had a small fridge and a Keurig coffee pot. The king bed was very comfortable and the linens were great. The bathroom was small, but the shower was large. I agree with other reviews that the bathroom door is odd. It's frosted glass and not as private as a bathroom should be. And if someone uses the bathroom in the middle of the night, the bathroom light wakes up the people in the bedroom because the door faces the head of the bed. Everyone was helpful and friendly and we would return.",5,Annie143Florida,March 2019
730,"Been there, seen it, and try to forget it","In the past, I have been there several times. But I must say it has changed. When I got there, I had to stand ion line to get to the reception. The rooms are still smal, but this time also not clean. Food is lousy, service mediocre, and the place is packed with Highschool kids, tourist folks and grumpy outoftowners. Oh, and I forgot to mention: the bathtub dates from probably before WWII... Not my thing (anymore). I changed the hotel in the middle of the night...",2,975manrey975,March 2019

734,Good place,"Perfect location! It’s right near Broadway. Comfy beds. Really clean. Nice lobby. All the staff was professional and kind. Plus Kareem with security was especially helpful and made us very feel safe. I highly recommend staying here for anyone coming to NYC, especially if it’s a first time visit.",5,Grace Pritt,March 2019
735,Beautiful Hotel,"We stayed 2 nights at this hotel. A family member came out from Utah so we had to show her the city!! Our room was nice and we were super excited to see that they have the movies that you can order from the tv. So we figured after exploring we would rent some movies until we fell asleep. Unfortunately they were having problems with the wifi and the tv movies wouldnt connect. We went down to complain and they switched our room, the tv worked in that room but the room was so small that we couldn't even maneuver around. So we went to the front desk and spoke with the manager. She upgraded our room to a higher level but again the tv movies werent working. We were exhausted so we just stayed in that room since the manager said the tvs would be fixed by the next day. The next morning we checked and it was working. We left for the day to explore the city and when we returned around 10pm the tv again was not working. So again we made our way to complain and they could see our frustration. They handled the matter so professionally and helped us out in a huge way. The staff was extremely friendly dispite our issues. I'd like to say Thank you to David, Laura, Marisella and Angel. They were so accommodating and such wonderful people that even with our issues I will definitely stay at this hotel again. The rooms were clean, they had bottles of water in the room for their guest, the beds were comfy and I loved that they had security at the elevators so not just anyone could go in. I took some pictures of our first room and then some of the room we were upgraded to. We had a wonderful stay and the location of this hotel couldn't have been any better. Ive stayed in many hotels in NYC and this hotel is definitely my favorite!!!",5,Breyan M,March 2019
736,Excellent hotel!!,"Wow, where do I start? I have stayed in New York a few times and this is the best hotel I’ve stayed in by far. The customer service was excellent, nothing was too much trouble. My partner and I got engaged during our stay and they left a congratulations card and bottle of wine in our room for us. The room was clean and had all the facilities you’d expect. Location is perfect. I really cannot fault this hotel. Just perfect. Thank you for making our stay extra special.",5,Lexi085,February 2019

738,Absolutely perfect!,"Hotel Edison is our go to hotel when we visit NYC! The location is perfect (we walked to the hotel from penn station ... and then from there to a show, dinner, even Central Park on a nice day!). We stayed in a newly renovated room that was clean and a great size for NYC. The attached restaurant and bars are fantastic - so no need to even leave if you’re looking for a one stop visit! The highlight of our stay every time is the director of guest relations - Rommel Gopez! He’s welcoming, kind, helpful, upbeat and ALWAYS makes us feel right at home! We will continue staying here for many visits to come!!!!! Thanks again for a perfect getaway!",5,J N,February 2019
739,Great Location for NYC Adventure,"Perfect location for our annual trip to meet up with friends for Broadway shows, NYC food and shopping.Our rooms were clean and well equipped.

She does her job quite well with a great smile.We also tried Friedman's this trip for Breakfast and were not disappointed. Highly recommend The Edison for your NYC getaway.",5,Sheila K,March 2019
740,"Terrible Place! Nice People, but.....","I checked in to this hotel with some trepidation after reading some of the reviews here. I specifically paid attention to the advice telling me to ask for a ""renovated"" room, which I did. As soon as I walked in the door, I immediately wondered how they considered this room renovated. OK, it did have an updated bathroom, but the carpet was frayed, the wood doors and trim were battered to the point it looked like someone had a brawl in the room, and the dust behind the coffee maker was an inch thick. I put all that aside since I knew the room rate was good. However, when I could never connect to the hotel wifi, even with assistance by a third party they use for technical issues, I started to question my  decision. The straw that broke the camel's back was when I turned on the heater, which never went on, even when I bumped it up to 86. It's winter in NYC, and the temperature outside was 29 degrees. There's no way I could survive without heat. I packed up my things, went down to the front desk, and told them I was not staying. They did try to show me another room, but with no wifi, it made my stay impossible since I was working from my room. Believe the other bad reviews and don't stay at this place. I feel sorry for the employees who have to work there. They fully knew that my points were valid, especially when I said ""if this is a renovated room, I'd hate to see the classic room choice!""

742,Disappointed,"I travelled with family to New York as part of a two resort holiday. Second resort was Las Vegas. We had two rooms booked at Edison Hotel, We arrived quite tired but excited to be in New York. Having read reviews before I left, I emailed to client services four days in advance requesting refurbished rooms as reviews said some rooms were very dated. I never received a reply but thought when we arrived we might be accommodated in the refurbed rooms. We were given rooms on the fourth floor. When i got into the room I was very disappointed as it was apparent we were given the dated rooms. We left our bags and went for something to eat. The location of the hotel was great to Times Square with lots to see and do. We returned to the hotel and we had to show our room keys to security before we were able to get to the lifts which was good. Back in the room we realised we located on the main street. We had blackout blinds as were opposite flashing signs on the buildings across the street. I was expecting a coffee machine in the room but there was none. There was an iron but no ironing board. The toilet leaked when flushed and the bath had seen better days. When didn't get much sleep as the room lit up with the flashing signs across the street coming in from the sides of the blinds. There was constant noise from the refuse collections, deliveries and traffic all night long. We were there for three nights and were only in the hotel to sleep as there was so much to see. There were workmen on the same floor gutting out rooms and there was a strong smell of paint. Don't think I could have stayed any longer with the lack of sleep. We didn't eat at the hotel so cannot comment on that. The concierge was very helpful in organising an early morning taxi back to the airport for the next stage of our holiday. I had read a lot of good reviews for the Edison so my poor review is based on the room. If staying here ask for a higher floor and a refurbished room.",2,jp1512,February 2019

750,Fantastic location!,"We were so delighted with the location of this hotel - couldn't have asked for better.  As we were travelling as a group of 4, we had previously asked the hotel to put us on the same floor.  Eventually they were able to accommodate this which was very much appreciated!  We didn't spend much time around the hotel but the men on duty were always very courteous and professional.The two of us who shared a double room had more floor space than those who shared the twin room but all in all the rooms were clean, beds comfortable and it just was somewhere we slept for the night.  Yes some aspects could do with a little TLC but overall the rooms were great! We were on the 5th floor and were pleasantly surprised that there was so little night time noise so we had a great night's sleep each of the night's we were there!The only thing I would put as a negative was that the Wi-Fi run out on our second last day.  If we wanted more Wi-Fi, we would have to have purchased it which we refused to do - this was inconvenient for us as we were unable to check our flight details etc for travelling home.  We couldn't understand why the Wi-Fi was not accessible for guests for the duration of their stay in Hotel Edison.  But overall, it did not detract from our enjoyment of our stay in the hotel.I would have no hesitations in returning to this hotel and I would most definitely recommend it to anyone travelling to NYC....LOCATION, LOCATION LOCATION!!",4,784ChristineD,February 2019

We checked in after a long day of travelling and the room wasn’t what I expected at all, I was very disappointed as I wanted this trip to be special for my fiancé. I went to reception and a lovely gentleman by the name of Danny assisted me and promised me he would help. True to his word he did!! He called for the manager, skirt and together they picked another room, after viewing the second room I still wasn’t over the moon as wasn’t what I was expecting, skirt and Danny could not be anymore accommodating if they tried! They sorted this issue straight out for me, the arranger another room, they let us view it first to make sure it was what we wanted and had it moved as soon as was possible. Not only was the new room stunning beautiful and comfortable but they also had wine sent up for us complimentary ☺️ Skirt and Danny were so lovely, friendly and kind, exactly what you would want from staff in the service industry. They both went above and beyond to help me out and wanted the trip to be as special I wanted it to be for my fiancé. Truly lovely, genuine people, they both stole my heart a little bit ☺️ really grateful to them both for making this trip special, I am forever grateful and I wish all people could be as smiley and lovely as they are.",5,TiffanyJames24,March 2019

758,Absolutely shocking.,"Not much to say about this hotel except for the fact that this place is most definitely the WORST hotel I’ve ever stayed in. I’ve been to New York a couple of times and thought I’d give this place a try because of its location (by the way, this is it’s ONLY redeeming quality.) Boy, was I wrong. The reception staff in this hotel have extremely horrific customer serivce, with one in particular I believe to be Jennifer, was the rudest one I encountered. We experienced multiple plumbing issues, followed by lack of reciprocation of communication from the reception desk regarding someone to come fix our bath/toilet AND shower.  It took quite possibly 6 or 7 attempts to even get reception to adhere to our request, which is shocking behaviour from apparent “customer service staff.”The rooms are extremely outdated with nothing but a bed and a bathroom. If you’re looking for a hotel to stay in during your time in New York, I’d highly recommend you go anywhere but this hotel - 100% not worth any of the money, hassle or grief that you will encounter during a stay here. Honestly, go somewhere else - just see from the hundreds of other negative reviews on this website. I would give this 0 stars if I could.",1,Resort823986,March 2019
759,Great hotel,Arrived and very easy to find hotel 1/2 block from Times Square. Check in was fast and efficient. Room was a bit on small side but it is NYC so that is expected. Nicely remodeled room with a great king bed and a nice shower with lots of space. Very little wait for elevator considering we were on 18th floor. Served purpose since only there for short periods of time as we were out most of the time sightseeing. Everything imaginable nearby to shop and eat at. Hreat price for location. One place I recommend staying at.,5,Benji O,February 2019
760,"Good location, less than average room","Great looking hotel in a fabulous location, just around the corner from Times Square.  However, the room left something to be desired.  Very basic and small.  I know that rooms in Manhattan are not renowned for the space and this was a standard room, but this was very small and the bath was a disgrace.  It was clean but it was well past its upgrade time.  For the price we paid I was not impressed.",3,jazz-duo,October 2018
761,AWFUL AVOID!!!!!,I recently visited with my partner awful rude staff dirty rooms and when I told them I wasn’t happy all they said was no one complains in New York!! I contacted my agent and they offered me 1 night free! That was £83 I said I would accept a little more as I was not happy for the full 5 days not just 1 day and all they said was they was not willing to do anything more for me!!! AWFUL PLACE! Disgusting manners!! How they are still open is beyond me!!,1,Emannn,February 2019
762,Wonderful visit!   Danny and Skirt Are great!,"I have stayed at Hotel Edison several times in the past few years and had always enjoyed my visit.  This time they had upped their game and it was even better than before. Everyone was friendly and helpful and we had an updated room. There were four of us in three different rooms and they were all nice and spacious especially for New York City. I love the convenience of the hotel, it is close to most of the theaters and only steps away from time square and the TKTS booth. I think it is the best value for hotels if you want to stay in the Time Square area.   Danny and Skirt  we’re so helpful, we will definitely be back!",5,dcwall,March 2019
763,"Lovely, clean, friendly, art deco-style hotel in great location","Spent 3 nights at Hotel Edison last week and completely enjoyed our stay. Around the corner from Times Square but the room (20th floor) was quiet. Security checks at elevator very much appreciated. Room was small but great: excellent bed, high quality sheets, towels, bath products, bath robe. Keurig and bottled water in the room. Very friendly staff, especially Justina at the front desk. Enjoyed the live music, finger foods, and wine on Friday night. Loved the art-deco decor - it was like stepping back in time and gorgeous.Surprisingly the person at the tourist desk was unhelpful but at least provided us with a map.Overall, this was a great hotel experience and I would be happy to stay here again.",5,Bagel1998,February 2019
764,Beautiful Art Deco hotel with wonderful staff near Times Square,"Gorgeously renovated & restored 1931 Art Deco building. Thomas Edison himself helped open the hotel by turning on the lights!I've had the pleasure to stay here four times now. The rooms have always been spacious, well-appointed, and clean, as are the beautiful tile & marble bathrooms. The staff is so friendly & helpful & refreshingly diverse. There's a lovely bar near the lobby that has live music almost every night. On Tuesdays(?) and Fridays at 6 I think there's a complimentary wine & music social hour for guests in the magnificent lobby. There are beautiful Deco style murals throughout the ground floor & lobby.A room with a balcony or terrace if you can get one is well worth the extra money. We were lucky to be upgraded once and the view was amazing, plus getting to see some of the architectural details up close on the outside of the building was special. You can often find better rates & deals too if you look for dates in the off-season.",5,Renee,March 2019
765,Perfect location for Broadway shows!,"It had been years since we have visited the Theatre District and Times Square, so I researched (mainly on Trip Advisor) for the perfect location for our short 3 day visit. The Signature King Suite with Terrace was just what we’d hoped. Very clean and comfortable, with 2 televisions and a sofa bed in addition to the king bed. Amazingly quiet for just a few feet off Broadway and Times Square. Love Art Deco period and the artwork in the lobby is delightful. Front desk staff, security, housekeeping and guest relations staff were kind, polite, and on point. They were all happy to answer any questions and make suggestions. I’ll be back as this hotel is in the perfect location for Broadway Show visits!",5,Jan M,February 2019
766,City Break,Had a great 4 night stay in February. Everything was as we expected. Our first room was too small for two adults but this was very quickly and efficiently rectified by Juan on reception who upgraded us. We attended two managers receptions on Tuesday and Friday which was a nice touch.The hotel location is ideally situated next to Times Square and perfect for all the other attractions,4,TFCK,March 2019
767,Top vacation,"Just returned home after a fantastic vacation at the Edison Hotel Times Square with my son and daughter-in-law, hotel very comfortable and beautiful and clean, our rooms were also very comfy and clean, staff very friendly and always ready to help in any way, we would like to say a huge thank you to Bobby the extremely friendly doorman for his daily chats which we all loved and looked forward to each day, we miss you Bobby, we will certainly recommend the Edison Hotel to family and friends, we have very special memories of our stay in New York. Thank you all.",5,mansi12016,February 2019
768,Great room and location,"We had a signature king mini suite for a great price!  Right in the heart of Times Square.  It had a refrigerator, Keurig machine, desk, couch, 2 tvs and comfortable bed.  Water bottles provided.  Staff were all nice.  Security officer especially when I lost my iPhone charger while out and about, he gave me a new one to use (from old lost and found).",4,Rebecca,February 2019
769,Good located hotel to explore New York,"A good hotel around the corner of Times square. Metro is at walking distance. Good place to stay for sightseeing in New York. The beds are with firm matresses and sleep well. A bar and restaurants are reachable through the Lobby. The room we had, wasn't big, but functional. Small bathroom with good warm water. The employees helped us well with our questions. Anita Dillon helped us well and  was very friendly when our safe wasn't opening.",5,Gerry S,February 2019
770,"Location, and Service","Great location, close to many theaters,  2 on site restaurants with great food.  Rooms are a little small, but why sit in the room when there is so much to do outside? Wonderful staff - caring and efficient.  Great security.  Reasonable rates too. Will definitely return.",5,maudski92,February 2019
771,"Hotel Edison, Times Square, New York.","AMAZING. This hotels location is absolutely fantastic! Room was beautiful, clean, tidy, spacious and has lots of cupboard and drawer space. The double bed was huge and so comfortable. Staff are lovely and very welcoming. The hotel is currently being refurbished so my advice would be to email them prior to arrival and ask for a refurbished room. I done this and because I was travelling for my 21st birthday, got a free upgrade to VIP So therefore got to stay in a signature room rather than classic and also there was presents left in the room for me on arrival. I could not recommend this hotel enough, especially for the location it’s absolutely fabulous.",5,Shannon Little,February 2019
772,Excellent location.,"Recently stayed at this hotel for four nights.  Our room number was 553, it was very small, not much storage space. but we were only sleeping in it, so wasn’t bothered by this.  However, when we tried the telephone it didn’t work.  We had no hot water, the heating system made a dreadful noise and there were “pipes” banging in the middle of the night.  We also asked for an extra pillow, unfortunately, this never arrived.  We complained about these things the following morning.  Without hesitation, we were moved to room 2028.  The room was slightly bigger and all amenities worked, the room had been slightly updated.   The location for sightseeing was excellent, hop on hop off bus was great value for money.",4,Judith,February 2019
773,Great Place to stay,This hotel is in a perfect location. We stayed here a few days ago. The staff were very helpful. The room we had was very comfortable. It was cleaned everyday. We had breakfast in hotel most morning the food was good and the service was good too. It was perfect for our stay we hope to return next year I would recommend it to my friends. Thanks for a great stay ☺️,4,Rhondawalsh,February 2019

775,Exelent service,"Exelent Service from the staff here at the hotel, we preciate it a lot from our Favourite man MR. Fehat helpsome and exelent service, also helped us with visiting tips, really great man. Top Rating from me👍🏻 -Peter (I’ve be back in short time)",5,Opt,February 2019
776,AMAZING - WE LOVE DEMARCUS ON GUEST RELATIONS!,"We booked to stay at the Hotel Edison during half term week. Upon arrival we were greeted by the staff with a smiling face and warm greeting. However, nobodies greeting could beat Demarcus Woods on guest relations. He was a complete delight and made our holiday. He was extremely helpful by recommending routes for travel, restaurants and ideal shops for the perfect day out. He was always around in reception wearing the biggest smile, it felt as though we had a made a friend within the hotel.When you stay at Hotel Edison, make sure you speak to Demarcus and he will make your holiday as he is a brilliant asset to Hotel Edison!!!! Hotel Edison is in a fantastic location for time square and Broadway theatres. The rooms are comfortable and perfect for your holiday in New York. When visiting again, I will be for sure staying in Hotel Edison!",5,Charlotte Emms,February 2019
777,Location is everything ,"The hotel is in an ideal location. This is definitely the best thing about the hotel. Six of us stayed here for six nights (3 rooms). The first rooms we were given on the tenth floor were very rundown and unattractive. One room was located opposite a rooftop bar and busy road... very loud. Linda the manager switched us to better rooms on the ninth floor the next day. These rooms were so much better. Refurbished, bigger TV and quieter... it was a like being in a different hotel! Would I stay here again? Yes!... as long as in a refurbished room. Couldn’t have done six nights in the original run down room. My advice is to ensure you have a refurbished ‘signature’ room.",4,David R,February 2019
778,Excellent!,"The hotel is in the perfect location, and the room was perfect. For the location and the quality of the hotel, the price was great. Best choice! I was in the 20th floor, and I couldn't hear any noise which was perfect. The staff was just amazing, and props to the security department. Would definitely recommend.",5,Companion796465,February 2019
779,THEY NEVER RETURNED ME THE $100 DEPOSIT,"Last October I went with my family to the Edison Hotel and we booked two rooms, at check in they asked for $100 for the deposit to each room. When we checked out we were told that in an average of 12 days they would return us the deposit, but they never returned it. During these months I have been calling and sending emails, but they never answer.",1,anpili1,October 2018
780,"This hotel shines brightly, but I was left feeling slightly deceived","The biggest point I'd like to make is that the staff at this hotel are beyond professional.  In my interactions with the front desk staff, security, concierge, bellhop, on-site manager, housekeeper and servers at the Edison Hour, every single person was exceptional in their friendliness and kindness.  I send my greatest thanks to everyone working here, they are all truly amazing.Positive notes:  On top of the incredibly professional staff, I note the following:-  Edison Hour was top-notch.  Excellent food, very good wine, fantastic music and a very warm ambiance.-  Friedman's Cafe was very nice.  The food hit the spot and the bartender prepared a top-notch Manhattan, which I appreciated very much.My only problem was with the room, and the slight deception I felt.  As I'm learning from the other reviews on this website, it would appear as though there is a quite a contrast between the ""Classic"" rooms and ""Signature"" rooms, where the ""Signature"" rooms refer to those that have been recently renovated.  The room I stayed in was the hallmark of a room that was desperately ready to be renovated.  While generally clean (and an especially clean bathroom), it smelled very unpleasant.  The heating/cooling appliance banged and rattled pretty obnoxiously through the night.  The furniture was worn and damaged.  And finally, the pull-out sofa was totally unacceptable - stained, damaged, with the pull-out warped, caved-in, and with the support springs popping off.None of this was really a problem though.  I've rated this at 3/5 because of how I felt deceived in the difference between what I expected at the time of booking versus what was delivered.  On the website, when you find the description for the Classic Junior Suite, one of the photos show a suite with a bedroom separate from the living area with the sofa.  Another shows the bed with side-tables and lamps at each side of the bed.  You see a coffee table in front of the sofa.As it turns out, the 'suite' is another way of saying 'a room with a bed and some extra space next to it'.  I consider that typically, a suite should mean that there is an additional separate room.  Unfortunately, a few extra dozen square feet of space to me does not constitute a suite, and definitely not at a hotel of this caliber.  But this would not have been an issue, had the website not shown a photo for the ""Classic Junior Suite"" having 2 separated rooms.  This is very deceptive.  It's possibly just a mistake by the website designer, but I was disappointed by this.My travel arrangements made it so that I'd have preferred the sofa pull-out to be in a separate room from the King bed.  Upon booking, I emailed the Edison Hotel to further inquire about the room, specifically asking if the room would have two separated spaces.  I never received an answer, despite having emailed 10 days before my arrival.  Not receiving a reply to my email was also disappointing.Similarly, only one bedside table and lamp.  No coffee table.  And while I've slept on the most absurd of surfaces in my life with no problem, the sunken pull-out was a real back-breaker for a room that ""accommodates 1-4 people"" according to the website.  Luckily I was only travelling in a party of 2, and simply shared a bed with my travelling partner.  No hotel of this caliber should have a pull-out that disastrous.  When I got to the room and noticed it was different from what I thought I booked, I went down.  The front-desk staff was very quick to bring my question to a manager, who was also very quick and extremely courteous.  He explained that I was assigned the correct room based on what I booked, and explained that all the Classic Junior Suites are like this, and that even the Signature Suites do not feature a separate room.  He was very kind.So overall, a great stay.  After our trip, my travel partner and I agreed we would certainly stay at this property again.  However, I have to give this hotel a 3/5 only because I felt like that hotel was very deceptive in how it presented its rooms versus what was delivered.  The photos on their website ought to be changed at the very least, and more attention paid to responding to emails.  Amenities should be distributed properly.  Beds should have two bedside tables if the pictures show this.  And finally, a four-star property should not advertise a room as capable of accommodating four people if the pull-out is as miserable as the one I encountered.In the ruckus of their busy lobby, I didn't find the time to speak these concerns to a manager at the end of my stay.  And I've not emailed the hotel as my previous experience tells me I shouldn't expect a response.For anyone who didn't bother reading the entirety of this, I'll summarize:  Great hotel.  Exceptional staff.  Just be aware that ""classic"" rooms are a bit dated and unrenovated (despite being very clean), and that even if the website photos advertise the suite as having two separate rooms, this is false.  And finally, don't expect anyone in your party to sleep on the pull-out.",4,P. O.,February 2019
781,Great location and comfort,"The hotel is a half block away from Times Square, but the noise from that area doesn't carry into the room. It is very convenient to the theater district and many great restaurants. The beds are very comfortable  and the staff responds quickly.  There is a nice jazz club in the hotel that can be crowded, and their cafe in the hotel is excellent. We got an excellent price on top of it all!",4,higginswi,February 2019
782,Excellent hotel,We love the hotel. Excellent location and very friendly employees... also the staff make u feel you are the king and they take care all your needs... we definitely will come back and stay in this beautiful hotel... Rodriguez family,5,JP Rodriguez,February 2019

To the house keepers on my floor which always said hello and a smile. marion d.,5,marion d,February 2019
784,Unique and in Times Square,"We recently stayed at this hotel and really enjoyed our time there.  The hotel is done in Art Deco of the past and still has the charm of the 1930's, including on our floor the old mail drop box, where the letters go to the basement.  Our room was oddly shaped but comfortable, beds were comfortable.  Bathroom was small, but it's an old building.  Bathroom as clean and well lit.  The hotel staff was very friendly and kind and helpful.  The hotel was located near all of the theaters we were going to, so it made it easy for walking.  Recommended for a few nights stay.",4,Paradise202873,February 2019
785,Superb Hotel,"This hotel is absolutely amazing. Brilliant location, spacious rooms and fantastic atmosphere. Hotel staff do everything in their power to make sure you have an enjoyable stay.

If you looking for a great location and comfortable clean rooms book this hotel. Thanks so much to all in Hotel Edison for another brilliant holiday.",5,joy c,February 2019
786,Lovely Art Deco hotel - horrible room,"When we first arrived in the hotel I was very impressed, gorgeous Art Deco hotel with beautiful original features, it’s a shame the rooms did not have the same appeal. Dated, grubby and in need of desperate updating! The heating banged and clattered all night keeping us awake and the water in the bathroom was cold. I did report to reception after the second night of a cold bath and it was fixed within the same night. We knew we would not spend much time in the room and the bedding and towels were clean so it was ok for a base. Each time I needed Reception the staff were very helpful and friendly, and the hotel is in a great location. So there are good points!",3,zolababas,February 2019
787,Well worth visiting!!!!!,"Stayed in the hotel for 5 nights in Feb with my wife and 2 kids. From start to finish, the experience was excellent. Room was fantastic, all staff pleasant and location great. My wife got a gift for her birthday! Hotel provided complimentary food, drinks and entertainment for one hour in the lobby on one of the nights - was very nice. Bobby the concierge was most helpful and a credit to the hotel. We will return!!!!",5,Johnny,February 2019
788,Horrible ,"We based our stay at this hotel off the pictures on their website. We were looking for a hotel last minute and found nice pictures online so decided to book a room here. Have never been more disappointed in a hotel stay. The room is outdated, smells funky, rugs ripped and dirty, bathroom small and shower also dirty, furniture is all chipped and damaged. Thankfully we are only staying here to sleep and will be out in the morning!! Wouldn’t recommend this hotel to anyone.",1,Shannon Desjardins,February 2019
789,Not recommended ,"I wouldn’t recommend staying here. The photos on their website are nothing like the rooms. Old rugs, old bathroom. No curtains in the window. The best part of this place is the lobby, it makes it look like a 4 star hotel.",1,Det224,February 2019
790,Horrible,"The pictures on the website look nothing like the room we got. Dirty, old rugs, no curtains.

The staff were kind and engaging.  But the best part was the front end help especially Justina , she spent extra time during check in to find on line and print documents needed to fulfil my stay. I really appreciate the extra effort.",5,orib567,February 2019
792,"Clean, comfortable, small","The hotel is great for anyone who is doing a lot of sightseeing around NYC and needs a comfy place to sleep. The only time we spent in our room was when it was time for bed after a busy day touring around the city. The room was small, but didn’t bother us and that’s New York room sizes for you! The most important thing was that it was clean and the bed was comfortable. The shower was fine, maids cleaned the room everyday and  we had fresh towels and shampoos soaps every day. The location is perfect!! Just down from the red steps on Times Square on 47th street and also accessible from 46th street. The room was up high so was quiet enough at night and we had black out blinds - I’m a light sleeper so this was great! There are two restaurants and a bar in the hotel. We ate in both for breakfast and bond 45 was the best of the two and less noisy! I would stay here again!",4,Kirsten H,February 2019
793,Great Service in a Great Location - Couldn't be happier!,"Service from the team members of this property rate the property as excellent.  I recently stayed for a quick weekend getaway to visit my son for his birthday and was not disappointed. We had a great trip - due in no small part to the hotel.Rooms are not huge, but certainly adequate in size and comfortable nonetheless.Immaculately clean - a big plus in the city.  Great night sleep with good bed and even better bedding.Close to the action of midtown, and convenient to walk most locations in the area, or the subway.  Times Square is steps away, but not overwhelming.  Safe, secure and friendly.  Truly a can't beat location and definitely my new ""go to"" property when I visit 3 - 4 times a year. I've worked in the hospitality industry 35+ years, and would be happy to have the property, and it's team - especially Christine L. - be a part of our next visit.One last plus - they are renovating so you needn't worry about a dated property or FOMO by staying here.  It's not a costly trend-setting venue, but honestly a truly great stay - and let's face it that's what you want anyway when in NY.  Like the title says - Great Service in a Great Location - Couldn't be happier!",5,sbahotel1,February 2019
794,"Great location, rubbish room and sleep ! ","LocationThe hotel is right next to Times Square. Great location for sightseeing. The best thing about this hotel in our opinion. Check inVery quick and friendly. Our little one was also given a cute little Edison bear that he’s named Eddie 😂😂. Lobby First impressions of the hotel are excellent. Lovely lobby area. Cool bars. All modern with a classic twist. We were very impressed with the hotel until we got out of the lift. RoomWhen we left the lift the mood changed. Corridors were dated. Doors to the rooms in need of repair. Once we arrived at our room it was very dated. Tiny bathroom which reminds me of my Nan’s bathroom 30 years ago . Chunks out of the bathroom door. Very basic. Very old. Space wise the room was ok. Biggest issue was lack of double or triple glazed windows that didn’t prevent the noise from outside at 4 am every morning! Heating in the room was very effective but very very noisy ! All these factors contribute to having very little sleep while staying here. Our last night was quieter and we did manage a better sleep. Room was cleaned daily. Duvet covers changed to. All the cleaners were very friendly. WiFiWiFi was ok once we finally logged in. Speeds of about 2mbps. Ok for what we needed. GymDecent size gym. 4 treadmills. 2 x trainers. Weights, balls etc. Cold water. Towels provided. CheckoutWe were quickly checked out by the friendly receptionist. Paid the tax.

797,disappointed,"Just arrived back from the edison, booked this hotel for my wifes 60th birthday as she wanted to go to nyc, its a lovely hotel just so disappointed with the room we were allocated room 708, safe didnt work , door handle dropping off , chest of drawers broken , paintwork very grubby and chipped , carpet stains, and wallpaper falling off . we were only there for 4 days so just got on with it really , The plus side to this room was the kingsize bed that was really comfortable and clean, you would think they would check the rooms for these problems after so many people had said the same thing. The hotel itself is very nice and two mins from times square. i did email them on a few occasions for a nice room as it was  and did get a reply and that it had been noted , so if you are intending to go to this hotel make sure you get a decent room and you have a perfect holiday , staff brilliant, bar brilliant , cleaners brilliant .",3,sidlongerz,February 2019

802,Hotel Edison NYC Do NOT recommend,"The only positive thing about this hotel is the location. We had a rat in our room. Tried to call the front desk many times and they would not answer. The hotel is old and nasty. Having a rat in any hotel room is reason enough to not recommend. We spent a lot of money on this hotel and is was definitely not worth the money. No microwave, no refrigerator and we had a suite.  I will never stay here again.",1,Lad,February 2019
803,really pleasant friendly hotel!,Had a lovely stay here back in December 2017. This is literally a minutes walk from Times Square. We were given an out dated room on a different floor to the rest of our party at first so went to reception to request a room change being as we had booked so far in advance. This was sorted for us and we were moved to a room that was much more modern and also next door but one to the rest of our family.The staff were all helpful and full of knowledge if you needed to know anything. Would definitely recommend.,4,welshmum77,March 2018

805,"Average room, but great location","The location of the hotel was great for us, as we were first time visitors to New York, it is literally around the corner from Time Square.  We were disappointed with our rooms, we had 3 in total. my sons room had paint peeling off the ceiling and the television was hit and miss. My daughters room television was also hit and miss and she had to run the shower 20 mins to get hot water.Our room was very small, and the ice machine was situated right outside the door, the walls were so thin that everytime someone went for ice, the noise was very loud, and unfortunately some guests went for ice at 2am (not sure why!). We would also have liked coffee making facilities in the room, but had to resort to going to Starbucks for my morning cuppa .The reception staff were very friendly and helpful, unfortunately the same couldn’t be said for the lady behind the concierge desk, selling theatre tickets, who struggled to look up from her phone.",3,costello4,February 2019

They also have good restaurants and bars attached to it.  The room, however, was deeply lacking — it was old and dingy, especially the bathroom.  I have no idea what was happening with the ceiling.  Two big holes were knocked out exposing pipes and raw wood (see picture).  It was quite creepy. The blow dryer was busted as well.  I don’t think I’d stay there again.",2,pkeeton,February 2019
807,Great location but tiny room. ,"We had room 1923. No view other than NYC buildings tops. The room was small. The smallest room we had so far. Queen bed. A small queen! We brought food up and we had to eat on the bed. There is only a very small desk-bed table and a chair. It was annoying to dig into our luggage. There are no space to open them. No drawers.  A couple of small shelves. Tiny closet for 2 coats. A hook. A safe. Clean. Hope some day they get ride of old carpets. My dust allergic kid sneezed until I gave her a Claritin to stop the sneezing and sleep.  Its an old hotel, 30s’. It is fine hotel when travelling in the summer for a place to sleep that is right on Time Square without boots or coats to hang. By 11pm the noise from time square goes way down. We hear everything from the corridors but it was fine for our 2 nights stay. No late noisy travelers.",3,Nancy B,February 2019
808,"Thank you, mr Tex","First time in New York and I could not have chosen a better hotel. We have been very well received by Mr. Tex from the front desk. He speaks Portuguese fluently, which made communication a lot easier. But also, he was always kind and prompt to help. I highly recommend this hotel. We will definitely come back to this hotel next time we come to NYC.",5,Eliane M Fonseca,February 2019
809,"Awesome location, very friendly staff","This hotel has an incredible location. It is located right beside times square and it is walking distance from pretty much anything we wanted to visit. But what really makes it count is the friendly and supportive staff. Specially Mr. Tex from the front desk. He speaks perfect Portuguese, which made communication a lot easier for my parents who don't speak English. He was very prompt to solve any kind of small issue we had and he also gave some great tips for shopping and hanging out in the city. When a hotel has helpful and nice staff like him, it makes me feel like I am welcome to stay and makes the whole experience a lot better. It has been my third time staying in this hotel and whenever I come back to NYC this will definitely be my choice again.",5,Wellington Fonseca,February 2019
810,Great Stay,"We had a family suite on the Beautiful two room. Completely renovated. Incredibly comfy King bed. Perfect in every way. Love the reception wine hour. Meet Danny OBrien incredibly nice gentleman who runs security. Honestly, so glad we have a man of his experience protecting us. Hotel is so Tastefully deco decorated. Fantastic glad we experienced the Edison",5,Rachel G,January 2019
811,Good Hotel.....as long as you have a renovated room,"We booked a Thomas cook flexitrip which included accommodation at Hotel Edison. On arrival at the hotel we were greeted by very friendly staff who chatted to us about our stay in New York. We were given a room on the 6th floor. Unfortunately it was very disappointing. Paint was peeling off the bedroom ceiling, the bathroom was dirty and dated, the hair dryer didn't work, the safe didn't work and the plugs didn't work. The worst hotel room we had ever seen. We went back down to reception,and without being rude, mentioned that the room was not good.  They were more than happy to give us a renovated room on the 18th floor, which was much better. It was my birthday during our stay and De Marcus from Guest Relations had left a birthday gift on the 2nd day, which was very much appreciated (Thanks De Marcus). Location is right beside time square, but street noise was not an issue for us. We recommend the hotel, but only if you have a room above the 7th/8th floor. Customer service was excellent and we found the staff very helpful.",4,Paul N,February 2019
812,Thank you Robbi,"We first got to to the hotel and were immediately greeted by Robbi, the Guest Relations Ambassador. He helped us with check in and then let us know of the guest event that was starting right after we checked in. During the time of the event we saw so many exceptional employees, like Demarcus, working hard to make the guests feel welcome and taken care of. Robbi went out of his way to find out about us, and upon learning it was my son's birthday, he brought a special birthday treat to the room. We saw Robbi many times during the stay and he was helpful regarding food, shows and everything for our trip! Recommend this property to everyone!!",5,Jackson6,February 2019
813,EXCEPTIONAL EXPERIENCE AND STAY AT HOTEL EDISON @ TIMES SQUARE!,"Great stay, staff was exceptional from door greeters, bag check staff, front desk to management greeting you at the lobby. From the moment we arrived at Hotel Edison we were greeted and welcomes with genuine kindness and sincerity. The hotel front desk concierge (Justina) was absolutelty exceptional. She was so kind and helpful, even upgrading our room to a newly renevated floor with a better view FREE OF CHARGE! She also gave us pointers and tourist ideas, as it was our 1st visit to NY! We had an unbelievably excpetional experience from start to finish and Justina attributed to that. Special thanks to concierge: Skert, who was also excpetional and helped us with our bag check at the conclusion of our stay! Great Hotel, very clean and outstanding Customer Service!",5,SMQ,February 2019
814,"Nice, but could have been better...","We had a hard time checking in, our reservation made months ahead was lost. After a bit of hassel we got a room. Our reservation, that at last was found, asked for a room high up with a frige. We got a room om the second floor with a veiw of construction beeing done right outside, no frige. Not happy with this I asked for a new room, this time we got a qorner room no the 21th floor- very happy about that, but we never got the frige they prommised to send up, and stopped asking after the third day of our sin day stay. Gret location and a lovely hotel once checked in. Mostly a nice and friendly staff.",3,Stine S,October 2018
815,Thank you John ( JB) and Danny,"We have just had the most wonderful week at the Edison so much so we have decided we will be booking again very soon. Our room was spacious , very clean, comfortable bed, great shower and the bath robe was such a welcome treat. The location couldn’t be better with everything you could need on your doorstep. Sadly we lost our phone one evening and couldn’t find it anywhere. Thankfully John ( JB) and Danny went through all the laundry at the hunch it may have got caught up.  We are so grateful they were able to find it. I do find the cleaning and security staff members to be very welcoming. Thank you so much",5,Holiday lover,February 2019
816,Poor costumer service,"Great central location, however room was very grotty,  dated and very small, very little space to store our suitcases. On check in we were asked for a credit card for a $100 deposit refundable on check out, when I checked online banking $142 had been taken out. When we approached reception staff and asked why the extra had been taken out we were told it was a resort fee (none of which we were informed of prior to our stay) we then complained about the room only for Christian to be very rude and ignorant towards us. He did change our room and this second room was much nicer with more space. There was ongoing renorvations on the floor we were reallocated too but these did not cause any problems. Can not comment on food as did not eat or drink in the hotel. I am still awaiting my deposit to be refunded 4 weeks after check out, I have contacted hotel with no response!",3,gwill005,January 2019
817,"Amazing price, right across from Hamilton","We weren't sure if this was the place for us. I hate Times Square and often have trouble sleeping in a city. There were three of us - husband/wife/son. We were already paying about half what we had paid in Times Square before, but this place not only gave us an amazingly low price, but also UPGRADED us into a suite -- we had two beds in one room with a FRIDGE and MICROWAVE, and a nice giant bed in the other - TVs in both, Keruig coffee maker well stocked and nice robes - they brought up a third robe without asking once they realized there were three of us, and of course the usual toothbrushes, shaving kit, etc. The hotel had a blower which some would refer to as loud, but I didn't mind it at all. Comfortable bed, good pillows, GREAT LOCATION -- we came to see Hamilton and we could literally see the theater from our window and watch crowds' reactions as the show got out. There were several restaurants in the hotel and they gave an additional $30 off the room when we showed them our restaurant bill. The hotel was steps away from at least 4 Broadway shows -- Hamilton, Waitress, a new Motown show and something else. A five minute walk to Restaurant Row and easy walk to subways, Times Square, etc. I highly recommend this hotel and would stay again and again.",5,tourist,February 2019
818,Great hotel and even better location,"This is a great hotel with a perfect location! Would definitely recommend to anyone going to NYC!Times Square is a 2-minute walk (if that), subway stops right around the corner as well as the hard rock cafe! Honestly can't fault the hotel or the location.",5,Anna G,January 2019
819,"Bright Lights, Big City","Myself and my boyfriend visited New York on the 9th Feb 2019. We stayed at Hotel Edison for 6 nights, we arrived by normal taxi from the airport which cost roughly $70 from JFK Airport. We arrived to the hotel about 3 in the afternoon. We didn't have to queue for long as there was so many receptionist staff on the front desk. We where then taken to our room. The room was a modern basic room. There was a little note left as we where enjoying a special trip. Room was spotless and kept clean with fresh sheets and clean towels every day. The location of the hotel is situated directly on Times Square, you are within 2 minutes walk from the red steps, famously known for a good selfie. Your surrounded by the best theatres. We opted for The Lion King during our stay. There is an amazing wing restaurant directly across the road from the hotel, that I would advise trying if your a wing lover. I couldn't compliment the staff at Hotel Edison anymore than I already have. I particularly would like to thank the housekeeping staff as they kept our room spotless throughout our stay. I would 1000% will be staying at this hotel again for my next trip to NYC. Lauren",5,Lauren S,February 2019
820,"Great location, very average rooms","The location of the hotel is excellent if you want to be near Times Square. Unfortunately the hotel was not amazing. The floor we were on was terrible - carpet and furnishings were very old and smelt dirty. The bathroom was awful. The aircon was set to cool but as the temperature outside was unseasonally cold it really needed to be heated. After a few days and obviously a lot of people complaining, they fixed the heating. Unfortunately that made the rooms stifling hot. Attempting to adjust the thermostat in the rooms made no difference. The hotel staff were unable to help. They sent their ""engineers"" to the room who made some excuses that aren't even worth mentioning and that was that. Honestly we should have complained but assumed the whole hotel was like that. We did find out late in our stay that other people who were on our floor had complained and had been moved to renovated rooms on other floors. We were extremely disappointed.",2,916ldl,October 2018
821,Top Class Hotel,"Very pleased with this Hotel. Upgraded on arrival which was lovely for as we were celebrating our anniversary on this trip. The rooms were spotless and very clean. My two teenage kids had plenty of room to chill and the WiFi was fine. The rooms were cleaned daily and towels changed if required. All in all great location for everywhere, we will tell our friends and hopefully back again one day.",5,rhoadesey,February 2019
822,10 ladies on 40th birthday trip!,"After a lot of research by the Birthday lady, the Hotel Edison was chosen because of the pictures of fabulous rooms, the décor and theme of hotel and it's location to times square. we were staying for 5 night.The negatives first.. these are only my opinion and arriving back yesterday.Prior to arriving at hotel I had emailed the Hotel requesting the 2 rooms to be adjoining or close by and to include another room also made in a different booking, I had also asked about arranging things for the room. The email was never replied to and on check in we were allocated rooms on the 7th floor with the other room on floor 11, on exiting the elevator we found half the floor being renovated and we were rather disappointed with the room itself, very dated and peeling paint, the bathroom had many cracked tiles and the bath had seen much better days, After a very long day (and being very British about not complaining), we figured we were only sleeping and showering there and decided not to mention this to reception. There were 4 of us in 2 of the rooms and although the towels were changed daily, on a few days there were not enough clean ones left and only ever 3 bottles of water.. a small thing I know and sounds petty but was just strange! The good bits!Beds themselves were comfy, The lobby area is lovely and fantastic for meeting up with the other members in our party. The staff in general were friendly and helpful with any questions.Friedmans is fantastic, bar staff were very good and a comment from 2 of our party were 'the chicken wings are the best they've ever had' Drinks are very generous and the food is delicious, we loved sitting at the bar sipping our cocktails and chatting.Undecided if I would stay in this hotel again, once all rooms are refurbished and it's not pot luck on what you get given I'm sure I would as the location is great.. maybe being a bit more assertive at check in would have got us better rooms?? As a group we had a great time in New York, and made our friend's 40th birthday one to remember.",3,clarestravels2016,February 2019
823,21st Birthday present ,"Hotel right in the centre of Times Square which made everything really accessible. Fantastic hotel, staff really helpful and friendly. Room was a signature room which was extremely clean with a queen size bed that was very comfortable. Coffee machine in the room which was an added benefit. Bathroom immaculate, always had hot water in the shower. Door men particularly friendly and always great for directions.",5,sarah k,February 2019
824,Wonderful stay ay The Edison,"The Edison is in the heart if The Théâtre district snd right beside Times Square.  We were greeted l ike we were their most important guests.  Our Signature room was perfect for our stay.  Nothing fancy but certainly simply decorated , lovely bathroom.  The Hotel itself is Vintage Art Deco, simply beautiful.  Housekeeping was so accomodating.  The Bond 45, and Freidmans were both great restaurants.  The Rum House bar was so fun.  Couldn't have asked for more.",5,Elayna Z,February 2019
825,Lovely stay,"Stayed at this hotel for 7 days with my two sons, celebrating my 50th birthday. We was on the 22nd floor which gave us a good view. Lovely clean room, nice bathroom etc, bottled water, fresh coffee, tea etc. Convenient place to stay in the mids of times square, near to local shops, restaurants etc. Convenient for subways etc to visit places too.Free get together in hotel twice a week with complimentary wine and food, was nice.",4,S.L,February 2019
826,Edison is Delightful,"We really noticed The Edison Lobby greeter throughout our stay was the head of security DannyVery warm, polite and helpful. he remembers our name which makes it more personable.We even saw him accompanying an elderly taking the stairs. When checked out, he offered bottled waters for us to bring. We will definitely come back and hope to see Danny again",5,linda0103,January 2019
827,Great location,"We had a queen room, it was small but clean and comfortable. Coffee and water included at no extra cost. Right off of Broadway and Times Square and near the subway. We did not have kids on this trip but the hotel would accommodate them. We'd stay here again.",5,Aileen G,February 2019
828,First visit ,"Booked to stay here through our travel agents. On arrival we were greeted by pleasant staff at reception who explained about the refundable security deposit that would be charged to our cards. We were escorted to our rooms by a porter who carried our bags and he explained about the swipe card entry. The room was disappointing very out dated and needed a total revamp but the beds were large doubles and comfy. The bathroom was very dated but had hot running water all the time and a good shower. The hotel is very old with very pretty lobby and foyer areas and a small ornate lounge area but the rooms on the 6th floor where we stayed they need a full refurbishment. You are charging plenty for the rooms and getting lots of people to come and stay therefore you should be reinvesting cash into making all rooms worth what your charging and make them a more pleasant place to stay. We ventured into the Rum House it's very small and that dark in there we had to put our torches on our mobile phones to even see the drinks menu so we made a hasty retreat and went to Bond 45 situated within the hotel and we were greeted by lovely staff downstairs we could sit where we wanted on a Saturday night to just have a drink. We sampled the Bond Cup cocktail which was lovely and had a couple while happy hour was on 9pm till late. We didn't try the Friedman restaurant choosing to eat out . The hotel asks you to show your hotel key card every time you want to go back to your room which is a good for security purposes. Some of the staff need to communicate better or be retrained in customer service. We booked a shuttle bus at the Hotel to take us back to JFK airport were told to be in the hotel lobby for 4.55pm as the driver would be there at 5.05pm to take us the hotel concierge at 4.45pm asked people are you for Newark airport we said no JFK he said right you must go now your drivers outside so we got into the bus set off within 6 mins the hotel is demanding the taxi driver comes back as he has 11 more people to pick up the driver argues with him and rightly so apologises to us saying the staff are idiots so he us made to take us back to the hotel where 11 more people don't turn up as you couldn't get 11 on a small mini bus we were moved to another shuttle bus where we had to wait for 4 more people and only 2 turned up departing late therefore our new driver drove like a maniac through the streets where he took a detour to fill up with fuel  ( this should of been done before he even came to the hotel ) he continued to speed and weave in and out of traffic all the way to the airport absolutely scary experience for all on-board at times. For anyone reading this just book a normal New York yellow cab like we did coming from the airport we all regret not doing the same on our way back as it was shambolic.  The concierge did apologise but this fiasco shouldn't of occurred in the first place. The only good thing hotel is ideally situated for times square ,Broadway and the underground and a lot of the main tourist attractions is only a 20min walk away. But for me personally I wouldn't stay here again I would look for another one in the area",3,kh1354,February 2019
829,"Great location, Good value & overall hospitality","We spent just one night at the Hotel Edison and it was a great stay.  We were in the city for a Broadway show so we wanted something near Times Square and the Theatre district.  Overall clean, spacious, and up to date rooms, and a reasonably priced hotel in the heart of it all.  They also hosted what they called “Edison Hour” which included complimentary wine and food, which was a nice touch.  All of the hotel employees were very friendly and accommodating.",4,kak713,February 2019
830,Good location but customer service appalling!,"Where to start?! Let’s start with the positives! 1) The location is great. Literally just off Times Square you have easy access to all transportation links and many of the tourist attractions are in walking distance. 2) The rooms are spacious and clean, but in need of an update. But I think the same applies to most hotels in New York of this era- very grand entrance and reception however the rest of the hotel is a bit neglected. Our problems started at check in. The receptionist Charles/Charlie, asked to see my card for ID/security. Not a problem. The problem was he charged $100 to my card there and then without asking/telling us...which resulted in me thinking my card had been defrauded and having to call the UK to cancel my card. As you can imagine this caused massive inconvenience as it meant we were stuck in NYC without a bank card!I appreciate some hotels require a security deposit - but to take without authorisation is not acceptable. This opened up a can of worms because when my bank contacted me the next day to advise me where the transaction had occurred, we challenged this with the front desk, and instead of apologising he was incredibly rude, and bare faced lied! He said he had told ya he was charging the card. He didn’t. We were a party of 4, all stood at the desk, and not once did he say anything about any charges, yet here he was trying to put a narcissistic spin on the situation and tried to convince us that the conversation we knew 100% had occurred, hadn’t taken place- but if it did his version was correct! I advised him I wanted the money returning back to my card in the first instance. In the UK this would be classed as theft/card fraud. He refused and said he would take it off our room fees/taxes bill at checkout, which he would discount if we paid cash. Now, be careful of this, I think it’s a scam the guys on the front desk run. There are no taxes in NYC. Las Vegas yes, New York no. So obviously we challenged this. He then pressed a few buttons on his computer and quickly concocted some bull he reckoned we owed. The $100 charge he’d already taken, plus an additional $42 dollars, which we had to pay him cash for! Looking at the bill, it included WiFi (which was meant to be included in the price of our stay), and the use of a tea/coffee machine - of which there was none in our room! A completely fabricated fraudulent bill. Again, another attempt to defraud tourists! Fortunately i had saved all my booking confirmations etc, on my emails- so I told him I knew WiFi was included, he started ranting about my travel agent saying they were stupid and didn’t have a clue! I emailed the travel agent whilst at the desk, and told him I was taking this further. Travel agent confirmed there were no charges to pay, and herself lodged an official complaint against all within 24 hours of us checking in.the hotel responded to her saying this was a security deposit and would be refunded at check out. So the excuse changed again! I will also add, the bin in our bathroom had tampon wrappers in which really should’ve been emptied prior to us checking in, and the water in the room, 2 bottle, were open and used, with lipstick marks on. Not great. We literally used the hotel as a base and spent as little time in the room as possible.It was so cold. A dubious 1920s air heater blowing warm air out every hour does not suffice as heating. The windows were so cold and drafty. The pipe for the tap at the sink was also leaking and flooded the bathroom, which I reported twice and nothing was done. The day before we came home, I asked at the reception if they would mind calling our transfer company and confirming pick up time, as my mobile phone service was hot and miss. The lady at the reception said no. Point blank refused. Told me to go back up to my room and use the phone there! Considering how OTT the Americans are for customer service, the way we were treated at this hotel for the entirety of our stay was absolutely appalling! At check out, we were told the $100 would only been returned to my card after 14 working days? As they were waiving the charges? Well, they weren’t / there were no charges and they were caught on a lie!We raised a compliant when we returned home and got a poor, one paragraph response with no apology? Never again!",2,annaliese2209,February 2019
831,Perfect Perfect!,"Great location, top notch service, incredibly comfortable and well-appointed rooms. You can walk within seconds to time square. Plenty to do and see in the area. I had a corner signature  suite overlooking 8th Ave and the harbor that was perfect great staff, housekeeping wonderful. Security is  fantastic. Danny OBrien is wonderful and really makes you feel safe. Love the restaurants Bond 45 and Friedman's.Great hotel!!!",5,miravista,January 2019
832,Friendly service,I want to thank all the Edison staff and especially Christine Lin for the service. You are special! I love the Undos States and every time I go I feel more welcomed.My Aunt already stayed at the hotel and loved it.,5,Leonardo F,February 2019
833,Holiday,Lovely hotel. Great staff. Good prices. Always polite and had nice follow up email from guest relations manager. Nice touch. Customer service done as it should be. Only one small issue with room was that it was a bit noisy. But hey ho. Hotel is old and u know what they say about new york “ city never sleeps”,4,Stewi1977,February 2019
834,Great customer service,It was difficult to get the room I was trying to book for but thankfully the staff was great and helpful to accomadate it for me. Especially Eric the manager at the front desk. Excited to spend our days here.,4,Rbd,February 2019

836,"Location, location but maintenance & service needs work","We picked Hotel Edison for its theater district location, specific room arrangements(2 queen bed rooms) and to avoid pet allergies. We first realized something was wrong when my daughter was told that her reservation had been “lost by Expedia.” No 2 queen bed room for her. She ended up moving to another hotel. The next day, we were told that our 2 queen room was unavailable due to a “water problem”, but we could have a king bed suite with a queen roll out couch, which we accepted. In the future, I suggest hotel staff pick 1 story, and stick to it rather than being caught in a tangled web like this. The thermostat did not work in our room. We were supplied a space heater that was adequate. Also, the coffee maker was broken. The bathroom layout is good for a small bathroom, but needs to be cleaner. Grout in shower and around sink is black. Perhaps mold? Beds were comfortable.",3,Ronni G,February 2019
837,A-MA-ZING!!,"I don't even know where to begin!  From the moment we entered, we were treated like family.  We were fortunate to arrive during Edison Hour and were treated to complimentary snacks and wine (I did TRY it De'Marcus - lol!).  When we saw the staff the following morning, not only did they remeber us, they arranged to have some ""good"" wine sent up to our room.  The Concierge was very helpful in securing theater tickets for our stay.  The hotel is in a PERFECT location.  Yes, the decor is dated, but HELLO, that's part of its charm!  It is a very clean and safe establishment.  Big shout outs go to Rommel and Robbi.  Thank you for all you did to make our stay memorable!  An even bigger shout out goes to De'Marcus!  You are on the right path, and keeping it all straight!  I cannot wait to find an excuse to come back and see you all again!",5,Denice C,February 2019

839,Great hotel in a fabulous location,"Stayed here for 3 nights and found the whole experience fabulous. Beautiful room on the 9th floor, lots of facilities, clean and luxurious bedding and towels and plenty toiletries. We really felt special here during our visit. Easy and professional check in and out. Staff very nice and helpful. I would recommend this also for location, right in the heart of Times Square. Just an overall amazing experience.",5,GAILKELLY,February 2019
840,Hotel cancelled our booking ,"Arrived after a long day and flight, excited to drop off our bags and go exploring. After queuing for about twenty minutes to check in, we were advised that our booking had been cancelled by the booking agency three days before and that the hotel was now fully booked and could not accommodate us. They said they would try to find out why it had been cancelled, but that we should try to call ourselves as they were having trouble getting through on the phone. A family member back in the UK contacted the travel company on their emergency number, who advised that despite our booking being confirmed and paid in full, it appeared that it was in fact the hotel who had cancelled and had even refunded the money to the agency! It took two hours for our family member to get the agency to find us another hotel a taxi ride away. We will obviously take this up with our agency when we get home, but the hotel denied any knowledge of the cancellation, changed their story several times, denied all responsibility, and left it to us - one pensioner and two middle aged women, alone in New York, to find somewhere to stay. Interesting to read that this is not the first time this has happened at this hotel.",1,GilloKing,February 2019
841,Great base,"Great hotel, great location, nice bedroom, good night sleep, the rum bar had great music I would definitely recommend here, as a family, with friends or as a couple, didn't try the food so can't comment",5,nadia83Iow,February 2019
842,No record of our booking,"Booked and paid for a signature room 5 months ago, checked in and told there's no record of our reservation (through an agent) despite me having a copy of the confirmation. No signature rooms available and maybe we can get moved tomorrow. Not good!",1,Laura B,February 2019
843,Love Times Square and Edison,We booked a Classic room and the room we got was nothing like advertised. Very old and run down. Tiny tiny bathroom with no bath. Decayed door frames and dirty sheets. After complaining we were given a much nicer room which we were happy with. The Edison is located right near Times Square which was great. Nice little cafes and restaurants nearby as well. Christine and deMarco from Guest Relations were super friendly and helpful when I needed assistance printing some tickets. They were both so approachable and had great smiles. Thank you guys. We loved our stay here.,4,Doonab62,February 2019
844,Anniversary surprise ,"We have just recently arrived home from our stay here. I highly recommend this hotel. Our stay from start to finish was excellent. I messaged the hotel a week before our stay to see if we could upgrade our room as it was a 10 year anniversary surprise for my husband. He didn't have a clue about our trip. We also had our 7 year old son travelling with us as well as i wanted him to experience New York with us. Upon arrival at the hotel we were greeted with a friendly smile and told we had been given an upgrade by  management for our anniversary. We were swiftly taken to our room by one of the portering staff who helped us with our cases. Our room was lovely, clean and very spacious. The shower was so good and the beds very comfortable. We didn't really have much of a view, but your not there to sit in your room all day. We had someone from hospitality come to our room to give us some gifts, courtesy of the hotel for our anniversary and also some gifts for our son as well, which I thought was a nice touch. Staff were always lovely and polite as we were out first thing and arriving back late on at night. This hotel has a perfect central location and we will be definitely be staying here again. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay here and also loved the city",5,ZippyHughes,February 2019
845,Great location,"Hotel Edison is situated just off Times Square in the heart of Broadway area. Hotel is pretty Art Deco style, clean, staff great, particularly the friendly doormen. Good security going up to bedrooms. Room average size, plenty of space for 2 in double room, bathroom quite small but adequate. Has a walk in closet which is roomy but no light to see what you are doing so need your phone torch with you. Bed really comfortable, had great nights sleep. Ideal situation to see all New York sites with a great base to return to. Easy to walk to lots of major landmarks. Adjoining Italian restaurant lovely if a little pricey as is all things in NY. Great bar just down the street. Good value for money, would definitely return and recommend if you want to be in the centre of things.",5,IrelandCleo,January 2019
846,Complimentary Upgrade,"We spend 3 nights at the Edison Hotel Times Square. Check in was quick and easy. The staff at reception were very pleasant and we're aware that we were celebrating our anniversary, so we were upgraded to a recently decorated room on the 17th floor. In the room we had a nice note and some complimentary items, including an Edison Bear and cookies, which was a lovely touch. The decor in the room was modern, and had everything we required for a 3 night stay. The hotel occupies a great location, just off Times Square, so you are close to all the tourist attractions in Manhattan. You can get to the hotel from JFK by taking the air train to Jamaica, then getting a subway to either 50th or 42nd street. If we are back in NYC and looking for a hotel at Times Square, I will look at booking the Edison again.",4,MrDonMac,February 2019
847,Made my sisters 21st so special!!,I emailed the Hotel Edison as it is my sisters 21st while she is staying there and I asked if they could do something extra special for her. De’Marcus Woods sorted her out. My sister has loved her stay there and I’ll definitely be staying there next time I go. De’Marcus went above and beyond. Thank you so much De’Marcus Woods and Hotel Edison! Definitely recommend you too everyone.,5,ashleighmoore2,February 2019
848,Amazing Customer Service!!!,We stayed at Hotel Edison for our 15th anniversary. It was myself my husband and my kids. It is in the heart of Times Square without the Times Square price tag. First let me say that their security is great. You can not access the elevator to your room without showing your key card. So we felt super safe. What stands out the most to me is the way they made us feel. Their customer service is unparalleled! They made sure we were taken care of in every way. I spoke with several people by phone before we arrived and had airport transfers and dinner plans set before we ever reached the city. Steven was able to help me with getting part of my party checked in early by phone and even called up to the room the night we checked to make sure everything was as promised. Today is our last day and even on the way out the do the not disappoint. Eric was really helpful with check out and was able to answer my questions in a way that helped my understand everything I needed to know. He truly made our transition to another hotel super smooth. (They were booked for our last night so we switched hotels.) I am so disappointed sad to leave but when we come back I will not stay anywhere else but Hotel Edison. We had an amazing time and the way this hotel treated us was the beat part of our trip!,5,Rob3speach,February 2019
849,Good Hotel trouble at start of it ,"When we arrived at the hotel, wife went to reception and check in.  We had a bit of a problem as we were advised that we need a bank card to check in for security in case the room was damage. Mine wife explain to the women at the desk saying we didn't have any bank card and it never was in book detail. The women behind the desk was been rude to mine wife say if you dont have a card you cant check in mean we would have to sleep out in the strees. After a while asking to see the manager, she came out and spoken to my wife about which took anthor 10 mins but we got shorted and we didn't need the card.  The manager left and the women check yous in. When we arrived at the room 30 min later about the card issues we must have got the must small room ever which wasent and issues the problem was, there was issues with room its self from damage door, paint falling of the ceiling, cables laying around for some to trip.  So I went down since time and explain the staff member which i think was called Dave and told him what was wrong and I had to say he was more help than women my wife at the desk.  He ask to go too the other women at reception, explain the issues, which she then give me a new room and ask me to check it out first if its any better and I have to say it was.Everything after that, from the first issues was good, nice staff, great location and good security. But at the start was not happy how the staff member spoken to my wife and the first room we got",4,os221,February 2019
850,Affordable central hotel with great service,"Hotel Edison is my go-to hotel in New York City. As a theater lover, it's so convenient to be in the heart of the theater district. (As an added bonus, I am always given a room over looking the Richard Rogers Theater - Hamilton is my favorite show.) Service is always spectacular. As an added bonus there are parties in the lobby on Tuesday and Saturday evenings - wine, snacks and free entertainment. My one draw back on previous trips had been spotty internet, but the hotel has invested in upgrading their service and I had no problems with wifi this trip, even when streaming video from home.",4,Gerri M,November 2018
851,Very Convenient & Safe Hotel,"It’s located in the heart of Midtown , hoping distance to time square Very Safe , no one can pass the security to the elevator without showing the Room card or permission granted from the room , it’s a impressive security system Very nice bedding and comfy And It’s a VERY BUSY Hotel but front desk does their best to serve as fast as they can Highly Recommended",3,BasithZarook,January 2019
852,Perfect location but..,"This Hotel was perfect for location! Right on times square, and was easy enough to get anywhere form there.When we arrived, we had the pleasure of the 'Edison hour' they do on Thursdays, it was complimentary drinks, buffet style food & live music from 5-6pm. We were just checking in and a member of staff made us aware of it and 'not to miss out' after we had checked in. He was lovely and very enthusiastic!Other than the first night arriving and the great location, the rest of the stay wasn't worth it.The hotel rooms were outdated. They looked very old, eerie and needed some proper revamping done and they were tiny. I felt like I needed a shower after the thought of having to have a shower in their stinking bathrooms.. There was a slight draft coming in from the windows as well.The staff there (apart from 1 security man, and a handful of reception/lobby staff) were not helpful and just plain rude - especially the concierge woman, someone needs to up her salary for a smile.Probably wouldn't go back, but the location was perfect!",2,Amie H,February 2019
853,Great location ,"Returned to NYC for the 5th time with one of my best friends for a girls holiday and was looking forward to my stay at Hotel Edison after it being highly recommended by several friends/family members who have stayed here.On arrival we were told that check in was at 3pm and no rooms were available. Then we were told we could check in early for a $60 fee so rooms obviously were available but our faces didn’t fit and ‘Zenorina’ didn’t want to give us a room early.After a long flight and being up for nearly 16 hours we were desperate to drop our bags off and crash for a while so reluctantly i agreed to pay the additional fee. The room we were given on the 14th floor was unacceptable. No enamel on the bathtub, hole in the bathroom door - it was very disappointing so we were moved (without fuss) to another room on the 5th floor. Again the room wasn’t much better - mouldy walls and exposed wiring/broken tiles in the bathroom but due to the tiredness we stayed put. The following day i was still unhappy with our room. I understand that i paid for an early check in & not a room upgrade but honestly the rooms aren’t worth what people are paying for them anyway. Thankfully a very helpful and apologetic Melissa moved us for the 3rd time - thank you so much. Positives: Melissa on reception. Security friendly and polite & the concierge were also very helpful in arranging a trip to Woodbury Common & our transport back to the airport. Location great.Tips: make sure you have booked a refurbed room - ask for higher floor - VERY noisy. Due to the issues with our room and the pure rudeness and ignorance of certain staff i will not be staying at The Edison on my return to NYC.",3,BCD,February 2019
854,Sons 21st birthday trip,"We’re just back from a six night stay at the Edison.The trip was booked through our local travel agency which was very stressful as we were booked in as four adults in one room on a B&B basis  (total misunderstanding) so a week before travelling we had to pay an extra £762 for another room which we could only have as a room only basis.So after a lot of e-mails and phone calls we eventually got the breakfast reinstated for the 2nd room .On arrival we were given room 1026 & 1027 - these were two of the older rooms .1026 had the smallest of bathrooms I’ve ever seen with foam insulation around the pipes which looked unsightly .The room was spacious but very cold .The wardrobe was a tiny cupboard.1027 was really small and totally disappointing as it was the extra £762 room After a trip to reception for both couples we upgraded to refurbished rooms (1805 & 1700) costing an extra £214 per couple . These rooms were far better with nicer bathrooms ,wardrobes and decor.This could have all been avoided at the time of booking if things had been made clearer by our travel agency The views not so good .But you can’t have everything !!..As we were on bed and breakfast we had vouchers to hand over at Friedmans restaurant.We were given a set menu with a choice of 5-6 different breakfasts .As I’m quite a fussy eater and gluten intolerant I was really restricted as to what I could eat . On one of the mornings one of our party wanted a waffle (this wasn’t on the menu) and it cost nearly $20 which was pretty extortionit especially for a plain one with nothing on it .The manager (Ross)in Friedman’s could do with a course on customer service as his mannerisms and attitude will never win any awards - disgusting would be a way to describe his whole demour.On the other hand we’d like to say a special thank you to Robbie,Jenny ,Jonathan and Justina they are a credit to the hotel .I think we’d more than likely stay at the Edison again as it was very central to Times Square,subway and the Big bus ride and Broadway.We didn’t get to see a show but there’s always a next time.",5,Beverley B,February 2019

856,Edison Hotel New York,"Our experience at the Edison Hotel was simply perfect. From the moment we arrived, to the quick check in, assistance with bags to the room, and friendly helpful attitude gave us a positive start. The Manager has a members get together on a Fri and Tues evening to allow guests to meet other like minded guests, to chat about the New York experience over wine and nibbles courtesy of the hotel. This really makes you feel welcome and at home. Christine, who is the Guest relations manager was extremely helpful throughout and made our stay stress free (thankyou). This hotel makes you feel safe with added security in the entrance and friendly staff. The porter staff are armed with immense knkwledge and will help shape some of your desisions and offer top tips and best methods of travel. The Friedman bar is joined onto the hotel and is available for food througout the day. The food did not dissapoint. Mr Rommel Gopez, also one of the managers really made us feel very welcome. The Edison is situated in the heart of Times Square. A fantastic location where everything is within reach including, taxi, bus tours and subway. I fully reccomend this Hotel. Thanks again for the memories. We will will return.  We had a busy 4 nights, 5 days and with that, you only just scratch the surface of what New York truly has to offer.",5,John M,February 2019
857,Amazing. The little things make the difference.,"I personally didn’t stay at the hotel. My girlfriend did and I email the hotel to see if they could do anything for Valentine’s Day for her. De’Marcus was unbelievable amazing, he is an absolute credit to your hotel and I cannot thank him abouts for what he did for me and my girlfriend. The little things go a long long way these days and I cannot praise him enough; he restored my faith in humanity. I wish I could do more for him than just a TripAdvisors review. I hope he gets a pay rise for the effort he has put into this.It just goes to show that the hotel have the best staff employed at the hotel that will make the little things worth the while. My girlfriend has also said that the hotel was amazing and she would recommend to anyone wanting to stay in New York. Cannot recommend enough.Harry Underwood.",5,HarryU98,February 2019
858,Review,"Just recently stayed at this hotel for 3 nights. Will definately not be returning. Our room upon arrival was very disappointing. Room was small, outdated, cold and in serious need of a revamp. Draft coming in the window. Asked for an upgrade which i paid for. This room was much better, however, within 10mins of being in the room we realised there was a mouse in it. Also found a mouse trap under the radiator, in which shows the hotel new that it was there to begin with. The staff member did not even apolygise for the issue. We had to be moved rooms again. The third room was reasonable, however, due to the hassle from having to change rooms so much had put a dampener on our holiday. I definately would not recommend this hotel.",1,Condy92,February 2019
859,Great Location,"I had a confortable staying at Hotel Edison. The hotel is clean, affordable e perfect to being located close to Times Square. Surely I would choose this hotel again in New York. Excellent cost benefit.",4,gabrielmetall,February 2019
860,Lovely hotel ,"Loved this place. Bed ever so comfy, staff are very helpful and willing to help. Security is fab. When I got to the hotel I was upgraded to a lovely room. Being completely British I asked of a kettle and it was done straight away, also had an issue with the plug for a Bath and they fixed straight away. Would definitely come and stay again.",5,Nicole C,October 2018

862,Our preferred hotel,"We go to NYC 1-4 times a year and prefer the Edison. It’s grandly elegant, but usually excellent value. The location is the best. Staff is efficient and friendly from checking to security station. This time we had a big room, although a bit dowdy.  But bed and shower were very good. No extras like coffee maker or fancy decoration, but very adequate. They have a lovely restaurant and an active Rum Bar filled with their international guests. Anymore we almost feel at home at the Edison.",5,Janyce M,February 2019
863,Great Hotel for your New York stay,"For us this hotel was great.

864,GREAT. Forgotten clothes were shipped a day later.,"I forgot some clothes in the closet and was worried I'd never get them back. When I called, they were able to ship them within 2 days and that delay was only because I didn't respond very quickly to the email. The rooms are clean and the location is right on Time Square! Altogether it enhanced my already great experience, I would highly recommend.",5,Morgan,January 2019
865,Great Service!!!,"I greatly enjoyed my stay at the Hotel Edison. The hotel itself is beautiful. All of the staff was super nice and very helpful. During my trip, I had left something important behind. Not only did they find it, they were even willing to ship my item back to me at the lowest cost possible! I would reccomend this hotel to anyone staying in New York City.",5,Anna,February 2019
866,Another nice stay,"Have stayed at the Edison Hotel several times.  Great February deal!  The location can't be beat, especially for the theater!  The rooms are small but that's expected in NYC.  The staff very pleasent and helpful.",4,DMM91,February 2019
867,A GREAT TIME AT EDISON HOTEL NEW YORK CITY,"I have stayed with my family on vacation in New York for ten years in the same hotel. EDISON HOTEL. You probably want to ask me, why in EDISON HOTEL ?! I will answer you immediately without thinking. Because I feel as if I left from home and get home every time to the big EDISON family. Here, every member of the EDISON family takes care to make you feel great and are careful to find out what you need to meet your desire. The whole team, headed by the wonderful Manager, Mr. Scott Geres, is always smiling and careful with each guest of the hotel. At the front desk you meet Jennifer and the day is already beautiful. We've made friends every year, and Joseph is one of them. And he remained a good friend who worked at EDISON HOTEL until he retired. Jenny Iva Christine Roger, Carla and not only them, are people of hope, working back and not be seen, but their contribution is considerably good operation and communication of EDISON HOTEL in relation to hotel guests.All the praise for them and for the one who leads them so well, Edison Hotel Manager, Mr. Scott Geres.Thanks to EDISON HOTEL!I can't wait to see them on our next Easter holiday in April 2019.Dearfully,Andrei Aurel",5,aandrei24,December 2018
868,Fantastic hotel ,Stayed here with a bunch of friends for a reunion.  The front desk was amazing and the hotel was super clean.  The rooms were awesome at a great price. They had a free happy hour in the lobby with alcohol and food.  You can’t get any better with the location. It is right in the middle of Times Square. If your going to stay in the city this is the best place to be for the price. Highly recommend,5,pwheel,February 2019
869,In need of serious redevelopment,"I cannot express enough how dissapointing this hotel was, from the impolite staff to the dreadfully outdated room. The room in particular was the biggest disappointment, holes in the bathroom walls, no wardrobes, no coffee or tea facilities and to top it off my son and wife were bitten by presumably ""bed bugs"" on night 2. The location is fabulous but I really would suggest you to look elsewhere in the area.",1,Riogrande,February 2019
870,Girls' Weekend,"There was a group of us that saw Broadway shows and just had a nice weekend planned in NYC. Hotel Edison was very clean, super friendly and we loved the historic parts of the hotel. Yes, parts are being renovated but none of that was ever a fact in a negative experience. Everything was very positive and all of us would stay there again!!",5,Amy Melson,February 2019
871,Great Stay,"My son and I had a great weekend stay at the Edison. The staff was super friendly and accommodating with early check in, parking and helping with our luggage. We had a signature queen suite. The room and bathroom were large and modern. The room was very quiet despite being above a busy street in Times Square. The Edison is an excellent and reasonably priced hotel in the heart of NYC.",5,jktjr,February 2019
872,"Location, Location Location","This was a special birthday trip for myself & 2 daughters, and we loved the location of the hotel, found the staff very helpful apart from a few grumpy security.  We had an unfortunate start with the pick up company but Laura the duty manager helped sort out for us.  Room we booked was fine, clean & tidy but bathroom was a little tired & dated, so we upgraded to a more spacious, clean, tidy and modern room which was perfect for us.In our room we were greeted with Birthday goodie bags for us all and a lovely note from the hotel, we really appreciated that after our unfortunate start.All in all I would go back to this hotel, albeit upgrade necessary(for me anyway) as you could not ask for a better location and the food in Friedmans was great quality, service & value.Hotel also offers walking tours & drinks reception for new guests which I think is a nice touch.Avoid booking Apple Commuter transport based in the hotel reception - unreliable, unhelpful & the manager is downright rude & obnoxious.",4,233JanetMA,January 2019
873,Don’t be fooled,From outside appearance seems ok In side not so much Beds are old and rooms are dated. Even with some cover up paint and they try to Make it better it’s not ! Location is the best thing about this hotel. Find another,2,Ageginger,March 2018
874,Great value for the location,"We stayed at the Hotel Edison and were thrilled with the proximity to Times Square and Broadway. We literally walked to 70% of our destinations for touring. The staff was extremely friendly, from our sweet housekeeper that greeted us in the hall each day to the consierge that helped us learn to navigate the subway. We were very happy with the cleanliness of the facility, but be aware, it was built in the early 1900s and the interior of the room we stayed in had not been updated in quite some time. However, the other side of the floor was under construction, so I’m excited to see the changes on our next visit.",4,Sarah C,February 2019
875,Great Hotel,"Great Hotel, Great Location.  Lovely big room, very clean.  bathroom a little dated but clean.  Great staff - lovely bar area st the side with food.

877,Wonderful hotel,"There were so many things that went wrong with my personal booking that the staff here made right. Starting with my arrival and no reservation showing up for me Taryn & Angel made accommodations for me. The next morning, I came back, the line was long and Demarcus assures me that I needed to go destress with coffee and breakfast and all would be well. Upon my return and with all the notes made on my account, Tex at the Front Desk was ok 🙄 Then I got Valbona and Roger!!!! All, I can say is they were just as fantastic as Taryn & Angel. All my issues were resolved. I walked away very pleased with the way my stay was going and looking forward to coming back again. My service at the Edison was definitely 5 star worthy! #HotelEdison #5StarTeam #Excellence #ServiceWithASmile  #KeyToTheCity",5,Jcan_Girl1,February 2019
878,Lovely hotel,"We visited this hotel in early January 2019. It’s in a great location right in the heart of Times Square. The hotel staff were friendly and accommodating. We had requested a complimentary upgrade and this was allocated on arrival. The rooms are clean and comfortable. Our room was quite small but was just the 2 of us so was ok. The hotel bar and restaurant was lovely too, the staff are very helpful and attentive. We would definitely recommend this hotel.",5,tomtay01,January 2019
879,Holiday stay in Times Square,"I was a bit concerned when I arrived to check in to the hotel.  The lobby area is not very big and the entire area was consumed by people who were camping out. Large groups of people with luggage, tables covered in fast food containers, children running around, a long line for the ladies room etc.From the looks of it, it appeared to be  guests who had already checked out but had no place to go, so they just stayed in the lobby (possibly for hours).  Forget about trying to sit there.  The lobby looked like this every time I walked by. In fact it was so crowded a women who was trying to navigate the luggage and people didn't see the rope by the elevators and landed on the floor.The check in process was easy. The room was clean. Bathroom was nice. I noticed the room was chilly so I attempted to turn up the heat. It just kept blowing cold air (in December) so I eventually just unplugged the unit.  It was better to be a bit cool in the room than cold. I couldn't even get the unit to turn off. The bathroom looked fairly new but the sink had an old fashioned hot and cold water faucet. Could never really adjust the temp. Either freezing or boiling. The room itself for NYC standards was a nice size. It had a small desk and a small chair so enough space to 2 people to be in the room comfortably.The room included free water and wifi. The configuration of the rooms is interesting. Some rooms face inward and some may have views of Times Square. With all the flashing lights and noise, I was happy our room was facing inward. Upon walking around the floor, our location was probably the best. Not near the elevators (some rooms are right across from the large elevator bank) and not near the ice machine (located within 3 feet of the door of another room) and not near a janitorial closet (which didn't really matter because they left all the service carts in the hallways every night). Strange that they took the time every day to unload the carts but left the carts in the hallways every night.The hotel staff was friendly, everyone from the cleaning staff to check in was polite and professional. With all the little issues, it was a toss up for a 3 or 4 rating. I gave the 4 because the staff was friendly, the location was fine and it was only a short weekend stay. We were also barely in the room.Had it been a longer stay with these issues, this would most likely be a 3 star rating.",4,JudyMetroNYCarea,December 2018
880,Does the job,"We had a 5 night stay, the hotel is in an excellent location, perfect distance from the heart of Times Square, check in and out was easy, service was very good.  We sadly did not try the restaurants within the hotel property.  My only complaint was the lack of lighting in the room.  We had one small light in the entryway, and one table lamp.  It was always dark even with the 2 lights on.  Other than that, it was a nice hotel.",4,Seaside255879,January 2019
881,A great location for a New York visit!,"We had a four day trip to NY with the Edison Hotel as our base and it was just great - so close to Times Square bus and walkint tours. It is efficiently run, the rooms are a good size, though the bathrooms are small but the staff are so friendly and there are two bars and one resturant on site to perfect!I would highly recommend you go to the Gin Bar for the love entertainment - such talent especially if you are a jazz fan!",5,38Teresa52,January 2019

883,We didn't even stay the night.,"I was REALLY disappointed with this room, so much so that my husband and I did not stay the night. This was not at all what was pictured in the gallery online and what I thought I had purchased. There were literal scratch marks on the bed's headboard, and there were also actually scratch marks (that looked like maybe they were from a dog?) on the utility closet we were across the hall from. The room was a shoebox and it smelled like mold, the wallpaper was peeling off and there was some sort of residue outside the trashcan in the bathroom... It was pinkish red. Overall it needed a serious deep cleaning. I will never recommend this hotel or go back. Luckily the bar inside the hotel was fun (Rum Bar) and had nice live music. The location was convenient as well, and those were the only positives.",2,Rachel G,February 2019
884,"Location, price and more = a good choice","I’ve stayed at the Edison for a number of years for a theater binge week. I keep coming back for a number of reasons. The hotel has a welcoming, make the guest feel good, atmosphere. Reception: this visit Juan handled checkin. He was friendly, helpful, and ready to cheerfully answer any question. Staff: I find the staff usually greets guests in the halls. The greeting says this is a good place to stay, and we appreciate your business. Features: clean rooms (some small but it’s NY after all); updates and redecoration have reached most floors: beautiful Art Deco lobby, fitness room, 6 elevators, twice a week receptions in the lobby with finger food, beverages, music. Location: 1/2 block from Times Square, close to theater, dining for any budget. Website: if your plans are flexible, check out the website to find the best rates. They vary by date desired. I return because I have had many satisfying visits. Hotel Edison—Recommenced!",5,Theatre Man,February 2019
885,"Wonderful, Stylish, Comfortable and Secure at Times Square","This grand art deco hotel has been upgraded to a truly wonderful place to stay.  The large updated rooms have amazing beds with frette linens and big flatscreen TVs, the bright bathrooms are floor to ceiling marble and tile with frameless glass showers, and there are 2 stylish 3 meal restaurants with bars, as well as the Rum House - a throwback saloon with live music and yet another bar.  The big gym is well equipped and open 24/7.  Perhaps most important is the incredible staff and management that bend over backwards making sure you feel welcome, and your wants and needs are met.  Incredibly tight security provides an amazing level of safety and that's while knowing you are in the best and busiest area of Manhattan-right off Times Square, surrounded by every Broadway Show, numerous additional restaurants, and a short walk, subway, or uber to the finest shopping in the world.",5,tanflyer666,February 2019

888,Nice Stay,"My fiance and I stayed at Hotel Edison in December 2018 (New Years Eve weekend). It was a pretty smooth check-in. When we first arrive the staff at the counter did take a while to greet us. The room we were assigned at first was located directly across from the elevators and was very small. I went back down and requested to be moved to another room. I was moved down the hall and that room was much better. It had a better flow to it. Overall, I would stay here again. It is steps away from Times Square and the transit system was a short walk (about 3 minutes).",4,NYMD6980,December 2018
889,Basic,Great location but a basic hotel when we checked in the first room was awful and stunk when we went to complain about the room the guy didn't even ask what was wrong he changed our room to the highemr level and this was better but still not much better than a 2 star hotel in need of a major overhaul,2,Darrenmcglone@outlook.com,February 2019

892,Location,"Just back from a stay at Hotel Edison. The location is superb just seconds away from Time Square. What more could you ask for!The room was spacious and to be honest after reading previous reviews I was a little anxious, but had nothing to worry about. Room was clean and maid was round everyday. Although, room did not have any tea or coffee facilities even though we paid facility fees. (Which I thought this was included). The staff were very helpful, especially Melisa on the front desk! Informative and  answered all of our queries. So thank you! Security is also great at the hotel, ensuring all guests are kept safe. I was just a little disappointed, it was my birthday during the stay and my partner did mention it to reservations on an email before we arrived. However, no special requests were made. No biggy just would have been a special touch to a wonderful stay at the hotel. Please don’t be put off by other peoples experience of the hotel in previous reviews. We had a great stay at the Edison and hope to return very soon.",4,pasty31,January 2019
893,exceptional stay,"I stayed at Edison hotel for 2 nights, of course the location is fantastic, directly on Times Square, I had a beautiful suite with balcony and a very good welcoming with a personalized gift in the room from Rommel, the director of guests relations. Also I enjoyed the happy hour in the lobby with live music and bites. Highly suggested. I will be back for sure. Thank you!",5,veronica g,February 2019
894,Fantastic location had a wonderfulstay,Staff really lovely  felt safe because security staff very good. Hotel had everything you could possibly need I highly recommend this hotelEasy access to theatres food in the restaurants lovely.Easy to get to transportation,5,Christine J,February 2019
895,Edison hotel time square,"Well positioned hotel for sightseeing. Staff were fabulous very helpful, professional and happy. After having upgraded our room we were very disappointed because if this was a recently refurb room I dread to think what the other rooms were like. The room was still quite small. The shower room didn’t have anywhere to store your toiletries. The grouting was in a right state and in need of attention as was the rim around the sink. An air conditioning vent outside rattled disturbing our sleep. To be honest this wasn’t reported as I’m sure something would have been done.",3,C W,January 2019
896,Clean and tidy.,"After arriving into New York from Manchester airport and spending over an hour in immigration and then an hour in a taxi to take us to The Edison Hotel, we got checked in very quickly.  We were told how to get to our room. So once in the lift we got to our floor and went to our room.Our room was small but functional. Depending on where your  room is in the hotel must depend on whether you hear noise or not. We had huge units below our window which were noisy (think something to do with air con) it didn't stop me from sleeping, so tired from all the walking, once we were back in the room, showered and ready to go to sleep it didn't take long to nod off. Nice comfortable mattress.There is traffic noise and tooting taxis but that is to be expected, after all the hotel is situated on a busy road. The hotel was a five minute walk to Times Square. The Art Deco style of the hotel is very nice. The reception and the waiting areas are very clean and tidy. For somewhere to stay whilst sightseeing in New York then I would recommend the Edison. I do believe there are quite a few different types of room, so if you like a larger room then opt for that. I was happy with the room, as we were only using it for a base whilst we did sightseeing and didn't return till late at night, it was adequate for our needs.",5,bev g,September 2018
897,Great place to stay,"Great  location, great value for money !!They were very solicitous maids, the front desk staff and the concierge were very friendly, and found everything close to the hotel, the hustle and bustle of Times Square, great restaurants and shopping !!",5,elietemlisboa,January 2019
898,Unresponsive,"I've been trying to contact the hotel, via email and phone, to ask a question which I need to have answered before we come to NYC. To date, there has been no reply (not even an acknowledgement), and when I try calling their customer helpdesk the line just goes dead.The question I have may seem trivial to many, but as we are both in our sixties it is important to us. Essentially, we need to know if, after we check out (12:30 I believe), we can leave our bags with the hotel until our airport transfer comes to pick us up, which probably won't be until around 18:00. Dragging bags around the city for six hours or so would not be a preferred option.Since the hotel chooses not to address my concerns, I regret to say I shall have to find another hotel that will.",1,Ryohei,February 2019
899,Amazing hotel!! Amazing Location!!,"The location was amazing, situated centrally to everything you could possibly want access to without being too noisy from the busy streets outside!! We were on floor 17 I don’t know if that had something to do with it but it was spot on for us!!The room was bigger and better than expected. We booked the Classic 1 King room (we were expecting quite basic and a bit outdated compared to other rooms based on other reviews) and we were either upgraded without my knowledge or it’s just a really spacious great room, especially for somewhere in the heart of the city! Plenty of cupboard space for storage and great amenities! Hair dryer and iron in room - both great quality no need to add anything like that into your valuable luggage space. Coffee machine too ... there was literally everything you could need! Ooooh also a dressing gown as well!! Although I wish there had been two!! Staff were all accommodating and helped with any queries we had!! Room was cleaned every day and the whole hotel looked top notch! The decor in the lobby is also really beautiful!!We came here to celebrate my partners 30th birthday, when arriving in our room we had a little goody bag with a Hotel Edison teddy bear, a bag of jellybeans and an AMAZING Schmakarys cookie!! Also a nicely decorated Happy Birthday card from Robbi! (We ate the cookie before I took the picture... couldn’t resist)Bond 45 restaurant attached to the hotel do a delicious breakfast - although it’s a pricier option, we ate here once and loved it but were on a budget so chose to opt for something cheaper in the city on the two other mornings! We didn’t go into any of the other attached bars and restaurants but the rum house always looked lively and the Edison ballroom had live music - If we hadn’t had such a jam packed weekend it would have been nice to spend more time here!! Also just to make you aware there is an approximate $100 damage deposit which was around £77 to pay upon arrival - you do get notice of this in an email but after checking out it will take about 10 working days to make its way back into your account! Here’s hoping ours comes back!! We didn’t take that many pictures in the room but as you can see from the ones uploaded the bed is huuuggee!! Also we ordered in one night as my partner is not used to doing as much walking as we did and was in agony! Haha!! Burgers were from bareburger a couple of blocks away and were delicious!! Breakfast from bond was the buffet option so both plates were mine... (the little Lego dude was how I told my partner about his surprise trip which is why he’s featured in some of the snaps)The only negative I have is just a really small one and it might be common in hotels but I wasn’t aware... I had a package delivered here shipped from America (cheaper than being delivered to the UK) and I called the hotel to check I could do this and mentioned it on checking in and when they brought the package to my room we were charged $8 - I didn’t mind paying it because again much cheaper alternative and I was super appreciative having it delivered here as an option, but on the two occasions I spoke to someone about this no one mentioned it would cost me anything, and would have preferred to have been told about this in advance so I was aware. Like I said though a tiny negative.You should definitely stay here if you’re looking for a great hotel right in the heart of the city!! Whenever we decide to come back to New York I 100% will stay here again and would definitely recommend to friends!!Thanks for a great visit and helping make my partners surprise 30th even more memorable!!",5,RSmith,February 2019
900,Open and honnest review,"Want to say wow! Wat an amazing experience at edison from day one laura checked us in and she was amazing to deal with. Robbie really looked after us at our stay i explained it was a special stay for me and my girlfriend he sent up wine and gifts to the room, he then also rang about half an hour after we checked in to advise us the do's and dont's on food etc. We then received some coupons for shopping  outlets! Unfortunately we did not get to meet robbie personally as we were always ""go go go!"" every where another amazing guy there that really stood out was the head of security daniel obrien we walked through the door he welcomed us had a really good chat. Gave us his card and mobile number and said if we have any quers wats so ever about nyc or the eddision to call him he also managed to get us an courtesy upgrade (you could fit aboit 4 people in this bed) there are many more what an amazing all facilities were extreemly clean and comfortable!!",5,Chris T,January 2019
901,Very impressed,"Was very impressed with the cleanliness, courtesy of staff, kindness and hospitality. The room was very comfortable and the bed was even better. I did not expect to have this level of comfort for the price. I would definately return to this hotel and have recommended it to everyone I know. A definate thumbs up.",5,Hannah A,January 2019
902,NYC birthday weekend,"Thank you Edison Hotel for making my birthday trip to see Hamilton such a great experience.  The location couldn’t have been more perfect! From the moment we drove up until the moment we left, we felt comfortable and taken care of.  We had a terrace room on the 18th floor and it looked right down in the Richard Rodgers theater.  Booked with a Black Friday Sale, so a great value for our stay.  Birthday gift bag in the room on arrival was a nice added touch and surprise! Dinner at Bond 45 was delicious. Portions were huge, could’ve split meal with my son.  We will return to Hotel Edison when we visit NYC again and can walk around the city in nicer weather.",4,Tara M,February 2019
903,Fantastic Location and value,"We have been staying at the Edison for over 30 years. It's a wonderful location, right in the theatre district. Room was very clean and the hotel is an excellent value. We look forward to our next visit. Lovely bathrobe and an umbrella were provided for our stay. Bottled water was included daily as was a Keurig coffe maker.",5,LFRDAR,January 2019
904,excellent location and service,"Had several stays in this hotel during Dec 2018 -- needed handicap access and always was accommodated.  These rooms are clean, well maintained and conveniently located near elevators. Hotel itself is close to theaters and restaurants and is one block from Times Square.  Two restaurants provide great food choices and  one is directly across lobby from elevators. Been there before and will stay again.",5,corinnetoo282,December 2018
905,Get what you pay fir,"This isn't an expensive hotel, so you shouldn't expect amazing things.  The lobby is huge, busy and impressive.  The rooms are small, very dated and basic.  We didn't have coffee making facilities/kettle, no hair dryer, no lights in the walk in wardrobe.. but it was warm, clean and the beds were very comfy.  The hotel restaurant is quite expensive, the 'rum house' jazz bar in the lobby area is also v expensive but has a great atmosphere. It's all about location... and this hotel is on the edge of time square, Starbucks is opposite and broadway round the corner...",4,connorbbennett42,January 2019
906,Fantastic location,"I really loved this hotels location, 20 yards from Time square & Broadway. It is an Art Deco hotel which I imagine was beautiful in its day. It is basic, clean and tidy with friendly staff. Great value for money and fantastic location gives this hotel a solid 5/5 for me. I would definitely recommend this hotel and stay here again",5,Angusoneill,February 2019
907,Enjoyable hotel,This hotel is a great experience and an enjoyable stay. The ENTIRE staff are a joy to work with and be around. I WILL recommend the Edison whenever anyone asks where to stay in NYC. We travel to NYC a few times each year and always stay at the Edison. Thank you.,5,Carolyn Domin,November 2018
908,Disappointed...,"It Was my second vist go new York stayed at the Edison. The room was a let down from as soon as we got there the people in the room b4 us there hair was stil in the bathroom, sink and floor the room was freezing cold the cold air coming though the windows. We should have asked for a different room but when your in new York you are out all day and only use the room for sleeping so we let it go. On our last night there we got in about 11oc had been out all day and we had to pack as we where going to Vegas in the morning a mouse ran from under the bed and out onto the hall we went down and said want had happend 20mins it took before someone came up to us and they done nothing offerd to give us a different room really there was on point only had a few hrs left. The housekeeping staff where only nice thing about this hotel.",2,xkellsx,January 2019
909,Great Location but needs some TLC,"Great location for Times Square etc. Staff very friendly and helpful. Unfortunately we stayed on the 11th floor and I don't think the budget has stretched this far. Room was clean but lack of attention to detail in refurb. Bathroom has been retiled over the old tiles, and not very well as could see the old tiles underneath in some sections. Kids stayed n 6th floor which looked better. Rum Bar downstairs was very good esp the Jazz bands. Be careful of room taxes etc on checkout as caught us out. Probably wouldn't stay again tbh.",3,DavidWoodward,January 2019
910,Not what was promised,"Having never been to New York and wanting to watch the ball drop on New Years Eve without paying exorbitant prices, we did quite a bit of research. We booked the hotel in February after calling the central reservations number and chatting to one of the staff. We explained that we were looking for a room that had a view of the ball drop as we have kids and did not want to have to stand hours in Times Square. We were happy to be able to view from outside the hotel but was assured that if we booked the Signature room with balcony, we would be able to view the ball drop from the room. I did send a follow up email to make sure that we could view the ball drop and again just before we arrived, I chatted the hotel again and was assured I can see the ball drop. We obviously paid premium prices and had to stay a minimum 3 days. We arrived the evening on 30 December and after waiting quite a while at reception to check in, we mentioned to the receptionist that we were happy to be able to get a room with a view. She was very surprised as she said that we could not view the ball drop from any of the rooms in the hotel due to the hotel's location. She said we should go up to the room and perhaps we can. We went upstairs and found that there was no possible way we could view the ball drop from the room or even from outside the hotel. We then spoke to a manager who was extremely apologetic and as we had written confirmation, she agreed to let us cancel and move to another hotel. As we could not get anything that night, we requested to move to a cheaper room as we would be paying US$750 for a room that had no view at all. Not even of Times Square. We were then moved to a Classic Room. I can honestly say it was the worst room we have ever stayed at. The bathroom was tiny and dirty and we were still charged US$550. The hotel location is not bad at all, however having done research while we were there, we found other hotels that were in a great location and far cheaper than the Edison. Staff were extremely friendly and I cannot blame them for being mislead but extremely disappointed in the reservation team. It was a very expensive mistake for us to be so trusting. The Signature room is pleasant. Not a bad size, however I can assure you that it does not have a view of the ball drop neither of Times Square. I am not sure what the rates are outside of New Years but definitely not worth the cost over New Years.",3,perthh2017,January 2019
911,Excellent hotel and great service,Came here on our first stop on a 3 centre break and have to complaint at all.it is at a perfect location about 30 seconds away from the red steps in times square and my favourite drink is rum so the rum house bar came in handy.We emailed them before hand saying we arriving for my 40th and when we got to our room we found a few gifts including a happy 21st birthday card😀The room/bathroom was clean and tidy and beds were comfortable.Staff were really friendly and would definitely stay here again.,5,Jonathan p,January 2019
912,Great location,"A friend & I visited to see a play.  We had a great time, & felt so safe there.  Our room was very spacious, with 2 queen beds, & plenty of room for us to spread out.  The bathroom was very small though, & had a pedestal sink.  That was difficult for 2 women & no counter space.  The closet was okay, but deep, & no light.  The restaurant Friedmann’s Was good for breakfast, but pricey.  The staff was nice & accommodating.  Loved that you had to show your room key to enter the elevator area.  They have Edison Nights on Tuesday & Friday, which is wine, & non alcoholic drinks, appetizers, & live music from 5-6.  The heat was hard to regulate, but the windows were operational.  Our particular room had 3 windows, but they all looked out on to brick walls.... we didn’t mind; it kept the noise & light out at night.  We would go back again.  Very walkable distance to Broadway & many shops& restaurants.",4,516bethl,January 2019
913,Thank you,My second stay here. Hotel with very good location. Extra attractions for guests at the evenings. Suprisingly quiet. Good standard.Breakfest in American style if you know what I mean:) Great hospitality from Justyna at the reception desk. Thank you!,4,Paulina B,January 2019
914,Great location and lovely hotel,"We stayed in the Edison Hotel in mid January for a few days. Arrived on a Friday afternoon, hotel was busy with a big enough queue for reservations, but it moved along and there’s was chairs to rest for those not queuing. The receptionist was extremely friendly and offered us an upgrade to our room booking at a great price and so glad we did. Room was perfect for staying very close to Times Square, bed was very comfortable and room had lots of accessories, iron, coffee machine, hairdryer etc. There was plenty of lifts (6) to get up and down throughout out our stay.Again great location close to everything, staff were great at all times, bar & restaurant were excellent too. Highly recommended, will definitely stay again.",5,Wayne Fitzgerald,January 2019
915,ROOM NEEDED SOME TLC,"I recently stayed at this hotel w/my hubby who was in town for a work conference.  First, the rooms on the website are NOTHING like our room.  I'm assuming that the sponsor of the conference blocked a certain amount of rooms and that they were given the low end rooms that have not been renovated.  As stated by others, wallpaper was hanging off the wall, paint bubbled in some spaces, our tub had the stopper with a chain on it, like my grandmother had when I was just a kid.  When we walked in, I could hear the steam whistling from the pipes LOL.  I joked w/my husband that although the room needed some TLC it was charming in a way.  It reminded me of what you might have found in the apartment building of the Honeymooners sitcom.  All it needed was a fridge with a block of ice in it in the corner. I loved the location.  It's in the center of everything and if you enjoy walking, you can walk to most restaurants and theaters and to the shopping district.  I would actually consider staying here again, but would definitely request one of the renovated rooms.  Staff was GREAT!   Kudos to Juan (front desk), Mario (in Friedman's restaurant) and housekeeping.",3,jsugarbaker,January 2019
916,GREAT SAFE TIMES SQUARE HOTEL,"Checked in with the gracious and knowledgable TONY who has been most helpful and wonderful.Room was clean, heat very good, comfortable bed and terrific location.I do miss the Cafe Edison downstairs but other then that,solid hotel.",4,frank_king99,January 2019
917,Perfect Weekend at The Hotel Edison ,"Amazing stay! Hotel is truly the best value in the city! We stayed in an upgraded signature suite and it was fantastic. Beds are so comfortable! Service, security and amenities are top notch! You cannot beat the Hotel Edison! PS love love love the dining options too!",5,Dee B,January 2019
918,A wonderful stay at a fantastic value!,"My husband and I first stayed at Hotel Edison 6 years ago when we eloped to NYC. Picture below 😊. We have stayed there every year since for our anniversary! With the exception of our 5 year anniversary when my husband was laid off. There are so many great things about this hotel! The staff is always super nice and very helpful. When we first learned about the change in ownership of the hotel we worried it would lose some of the charm. We were wrong! It has been nothing but positive changes! The upgraded rooms and amenities all done without a crazy spike in rates. We routinely take advantage of the cyber Monday deals. Being from Florida we love to come visit in the winter and see some snow! The Rum House is always a good time and we look forward to trying the new restaurants that opened over the last year. We are visiting again February 1, 2019 and are traveling with a friend of ours this year. We are always telling people Hotel Edison is the best hotel in Times Square! So, our friend is excited to see why we love it so much! Checking in on Friday and will get to do the wine and cheese hour that evening. We absolutely can’t wait! Bottom line, if you want a clean, safe, friendly and convenient hotel in Times Square look no further than the Hotel Edison!!",5,Melbo221,February 2018
919,Location location location.,"My friends and I went there for a weekend trip. We took the subway to get there and was not very hard to find. The location is just beside the time square. Isn't that lovely. You are in the middle of everything. There is a subway station 2 blocks away and mind you the distance is not that far.Checking-in is good. There was a bit of a problem with our booking. So i would recommend to print out your booking confirmation just in case. I think what happened was our booking was not in the system and so we hsd to wait for like 5-10 mins to get it sort out. We didn't mind it. Marcus at the lobby was so great. Handled it professionaly and calm. He was so nice. We got compensated for waiting and so we didn't have to pay for the resort fees. He also gave my bff a small teddybear with a lettering ""E"" (short for edison i think)on its shirt. because i mentioned that we recently knew that shes pregnant after waiting for years. That is service people.Room - we stayed at 1228. Close to elevator. There is atleast 5 elevator if i remember it correctly. So waiting is not long. Anyways, we had 2 queen beds. It is clean and neat. There was 3 pillows, quite comfy actually. Im the person who'd rather sleep without pillow than suffer from using one but i did use their pillow. The room is old. Bathroom is small not a fancy one. If you like having a bath maybe not in this one. Walls are chipping/flaking a little bit. Water pressure is so so would love to have a high pressure tho. Tons of hot water. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE RENOVATED ROOMS! A lot better than where we stayed at. ASK FOR IT! maybe you'd pay a little bit more but if you like great rooms then ask for it. We didn't mind our room hence we were there just to sleep and rest. And you can rest quite comfortably in this kind of room.Building/Staffs- the building is great. It is clean despite of being old. Housekeepers always greets you. Elevator is fast. Security is great. Someone is right beside the elevator and will always ask you to show your room keys to be sure that you actually stay there.There is a club or whatever that is in the hotel and a restaurant. We didnt try them so i cant comment. But the red circle room from 1st john wick movie was held in that club. :) Checking out was a breeze. Would come back again and try the signature rooms which are the renovated ones.Thank you.",5,ladysoul87,January 2019
920,Great customer service,"Great customer service from Justina at reception, as we had problems with flights and she helped in the best possible way. As we couldn’t get around sorting the flights, Justina helped and sorted us a room upgrade that was more what we was looking for.",5,Alfie,January 2019
921,"Bad service, unaccommodating and unfriendly  ",The hotel staff was rude to my family and I on various occasions. They were unaccommodating with requests. I booked a taxi to take me to the airport but needed to cancel it but they refused to let me cancel despite far in advance notice and was rude about it. The room walls are thin so there was a lot of noise. This hotel made my first time experience in NYC poor. I couldn’t wait to leave.,1,Mary L,January 2019
922,The full NYC experience at The Hotel Edison,"As soon as you come to front door of The Edison Hotel you know you're in NYC.  You can see the lights of Time Square, you see Broadway theater marques and the doorman is welcoming you like you've just come back home. Take a moment to see the architectural details as you go through the revolving door.  Once you're in the lobby enjoy the ambiance of a by gone era as you take in the murals that define NYC as it was.  My favorite is the painting of the NY Central locomotive.  Arrived too early to get into your room, no problem, the friendliest bellmen will store your bags, the front desk people are from all over and will accommodate you as best they can.  If your room is ready, you will appreciate the comfort.  The new signature rooms are lovely, but my husband and I are just as pleased with the older rooms. All the rooms have Art Deco overtones. And remember you get to experience a bit of history as Edison himself turned on the lights to the hotel that is named after him. I adore the C.O. Bigelow products that are in all the rooms and it doesn't get much more old NY then their products as the company has been around since 1838.The rooms are always spotless.  The housekeeping staff are always friendly and cheerful and wish you a good day. You never have to wait long for an elevator so you won't be late for your play. (At other hotels I use to factor in the elevator wait as to when to leave for the theater) .  The Guest Service representatives are  usually in the lobby waiting to help you in anyway they can.  Don't forget Tuesday and Friday there is a reception at 5 with lovely snacks, drinks and entertainment.  The back hall where a scene from the Godfather was shot has changed but you can still go to the Rum House bar and pretend you'll run into Michael Keaton.  This is my favorite hotel, in my favorite city.  Come for a few days and I guarantee you will come away with the name of a new friend that you made once you've met the staff.",5,April45,January 2019
923,visit NYC for theater,"The room at the Edison was clean and comfortable and a good rate in January. the hotel is convenient to plays, shopping and restaurants -- easy access to many tourist points from the Edison. staff was helpful and pleasant. all in all a good 5 day stay. this is the 3rd time we have enjoyed the Edison!!",5,Curious715945,January 2019
924,Excellent ,"This is now our “go to” hotel in NYC.  Clean, decent size rooms (for city), friendly staff, security, very reasonable prices.  Definitely can recommend.  Only downside was decreased water pressure in shower-but certainly manageable and overall stay more than worth it",5,Dawn H,January 2019
925,Great stay,"Came here with my wife for 2 nights and had a great time. Justina was great at check in and gave us all the info we needed. The breakfast at Friedmans was also very good. At check out, Tex was great when there was a small issue with my bill. Would recommend this place to anyone.",5,tallyman19,January 2019
926,Great hotel in a great location,The check in and the check out was simple and easy. The room was great and the people were very friendly and helpful. The location is very convenient to the great restaurants and shows. The in house restaurant was great for breakfast.,5,WOF,January 2019
927,Right in Times Square!,"Great hotel steps away from Times Square - tiny but clean room, plenty of hot water, surprisingly quiet. I won't hesitate to stay at the Hotel Edison again, for business OR the trip we've been meaning to take, to see shows.",5,Maureen M,January 2019
928,Pleasure,"I have stayed at the Edison numerous times over the last fifteen years.  The renovations have been beautiful, the staff is incredibly helpful, pleasant and fun.  It is so well located for everything, the theater, museums, subway, fifth avenue.  Even in poor weather one is right where he needs to be. It is so reasonable compared to nearby hotels and it is giving you a real taste of New York not just another chain hotel.",5,Sarah R,January 2019
929,Will not return ,"Went with my husband 15.1.19 to celebrate our first wedding anniversary on the 17th. On arrival to the Edison, we went to check just prior to lunch time I think. We were told we could pay a check in fee of $59 as the usual check in time was 3pm. I paid this so we could freshen up and store our belongings before going out. When we got to this room, opened the door, the carpet was ripped, the decor was extremely poor, dated, looked unclean, paint on the ceiling in the bathroom was flaking off, so we went back down to reception and declined this room, then we were told we had to wait til the 3pm check in time as no other rooms were ready. Hotel offered to store our belongings in a room until then at a cost of $1 per bag. I was also told the $59 early check in fee transaction would be cancelled. You do have to give a security deposit of $100 on arrival on a credit card in case of damages etc At 3pm we went back and were given a room which you would of thought was in a different hotel compared to the first one we were offered, it was lovely, modern, clean, good size, and bed was extremely comfortable. For the rest of the stay the hotel was just a base, somewhere to sleep. They do offer free drinks, and snack every Tuesday and Friday between 5-6 which was good. On the last day we checked out, no issues. Now we have been home just over a week, and have noticed a charge of £33.81 on my credit card, have e-mailed the Edison, have been told at first that it was a facility charge, we did not use any additional facilities, and there was no mini bar in room or anything. Second lot of e-mails I have been told it was an upgrade charge, when there was no talk of an upgrade, we didn’t ask, they didn’t offer, there was only the issue where we changed rooms due to the first one being unsatisfactory. Have been told I will be refunded, just have to wait and see. Staff at the Edison are polite ie security, concierge etc but reception are all about getting the job done, they’re very busy, no small talk or pleasantries. was made to feel very safe by the security who won’t let you in the lifts if you haven’t got a room key. Rum bar at the hotel is nice, did not use the restaurants based at the hotel to be able to comment. Location is good. We stayed at the Wellington Hotel for our wedding in 2018, and if we return to NYC we will most likely stay back at the Wellington, as we had no issues there whatsoever",2,lisa31,January 2019
930,Great spot,"Stayed here for 4 nights last week and it is such a lovely and quaint hotel, the rooms as not overly big which is to be expected in New York but the staff are fantastic, big shout out to marisela on reception for the upgrade as travel agent had booked us all twin rooms for some reason, defo recommend this place and so central to everything",5,derryboi38,January 2019
931,Run-down hotel,"The hotel was very run-down and dated. There was damp on the ceiling, the bathroom door was rotting and there was a hole in one of the lamp shades. Also, the bathroom was tiny. We were on the 7th floor and it was extremely noisy. Could hear everything happening on the street so didn't sleep well at all. We were going to complain when we initially arrived but the queues for the reception were so long we decided put up with it. On our penultimate day we informed the reception staff of the quality of our room and they were very apologetic and offered to move us. They were very friendly and helpful and gave us vouchers for breakfast for our last two days.Despite the quality of our room, we did feel the hotel was clean.",2,Gaby,October 2018
932,Great Staff and Location,"This hotel is a 1931 Art Deco style hotel..and what we LOVE about it is its location, right by Times Square,the subway,  restaurants, theater houses and excitement...   And on top of that, you will find a wonderful helpful staff...from the front desk and bellhops, to the doormen, to the lady  at the ""help"" desk who had maps, gave directions and suggested many wonderful things to do in NYC, the security guys and the Tech staff.   We have been going to the Edison for about 18 years and we are always happy to have done so.",4,Go173119,January 2019
933,Incredible Location !,"A hearty, hospitable reception or greeting, as in We got a very warm welcome when we finally arrived. Thank you very much Justina. It’s a really busy hotel but the staff are friendly and arranged our transfer back to the airport. You really can’t beat the location as you’re at the centre of everything. We ate breakfast in the restaurant which was nice with friendly staff.",5,XxxUNIXxxX,January 2019
934,Great Value for the Incredible Location. The only place to out you in the true New York State of Mind.,"First, the location of this hotel is incredible. Just a few steps to Time Square and the heart of the city. I tend to stay in this hotel a lot when I travel to NYC. It was the very first hotel I ever stayed in back in NYC for the first the early 90's. The lobby is like steeping back in time when New York was the Big Apple. The restaurants in the Hotel are very good, and they have entertainment a few nights a week during happy hour. Now, having said that, the rooms are a throwback to a different era. The bathroom, bed and room makes me feel that I am back in the 50s. I am fine with this but if I was bringing my wife for a romantic weekend, this is not the hotel for us. But when I come on my own for business this is my go to place.I know I will be back, even if it just to listen to the nightly entertainment where the artists are the pure definition of a New Yorker.",4,Thomas M,February 2018
935,Grand old hotel!,"What a charming hotel, right in the middle of everything. The people that work there could not be any nicer. They treated us like royalty. Once they heard we were celebrating a birthday, wine, cheese and fruit delivered to room. It was a very pleasant stay. We will stay there again for sure. Rooms were redone, very clean and bedding was so comfortable.",5,Alaina L,January 2019
936,Great location!,"We arrived on New Years Eve and were given a room on the 7th Floor. The room was very small and although extremely clean, the decor was brown and looked very dated. The bathroom was also small with barely any storage. The next day we asked to upgrade to a Signature Room. We had to pay an extra $20 per night but it was totally worth it. The room was on the 19th floor and was spacious with a big bathroom. It’s a really busy hotel but the staff are friendly and arranged our transfer back to the airport. You really can’t beat the location as you’re at the centre of everything. We ate breakfast in the restaurant which was nice with friendly staff. I would definitely recommend (but try and book a Signature Room).",4,famcam,January 2019
937,Roaring 20s,"Way above expectations. Visit Edison if you want to experience real NY, the way it was in its prime. The lobby bar (rum house) is probably the best old school live jazz music place I've been to. Customer service is excellent. Greetings to Justina who helped us a lot with some good guidance.Overall highly recommended.",5,Pan Sigmo,January 2019
938,Great experience ,"Great Hotel in the best localization in NY. I love the 20’ feeling of this hotel, the Rum Bar in the lobby has one of the best live Jazz performances! Staff is very helpful, special thank you to Justina for help and tips about NY! I will definitely be back.",5,Michał S,January 2019
939,Great Service,"Our family had a great time while staying at Hotel Edison.  Big thanks to Tony at the front desk for his kindness, wonderful service and help!  What a great gentlemen!  Also, a big thanks to Christine Lin for her help.  Christine was kind, proactive and confident.  She was tremendously helpful in problem solving for us.  Great job by Christine in such a short period of time!!!  Will visit again for sure!",5,James,January 2019
940,Hotel Editon Time Square,Our experience with the Hotel Edison was awesome.  We were registered on arrival and were given a room update that was a great surprise.  We are senior citizens who were only staying for 1 night and were greatly appreciative for the attention we received at the Hotel Edison. We highly recommend this hotel if you are heading to New York City.  We had stayed here several years ago and when we were going to NYC to see a Broadway Show the Edison was where we wanted to be based on a prior stay.,5,Granny Hess,January 2019
941,Adequate and central ,Stayed here from 10-14th Jan in a standard room. The check in was easy and access to rooms was by lift. The room was dated and small and had a heating/cooling system that sounded like it was going to explode every time you switched on. There was no hot water after 4.30pm on 2 nights and WiFi in room non existent so had to keep going down to reception area. It was central to Times Square and within walking distance to get buses or trains and restaurants. It served us ok as we were out a lot.,3,MrsGodsy,January 2019
942,Concierge,The Concierge here was a disaster. His English was poor and he didn’t seem to know any about NY without using Google   Very unprofessional we thought  He was also a bit unkempt not good for a frontline staff member,3,PatPlug,January 2019
943,Last minute NYC escape!,We made a last minute trip to NYC to see several shows in midtown. The Edison was a fantastic choice for us. We parked our car and was able to walk of take the train everywhere we wanted to go. The hotel is beautiful and spotless! A midtown gem!,5,Russ A,January 2019
944,Great old hotel!,"We love The Edison!!   Perfect location for theatre, and we love the ambiance of a classic 1930’s hotel!!   Great amenities and better charm!!  Everyone we came in contact with was very accommodating. We will be back soon!!!",5,TheatreLover24601,January 2019
945,"Great, clean, inexpensive place to stay in the heart of the theatre district","The hotel is great for what it is--a convenient and no frills place to sleep while exploring the City.  Our room was clean and comfortable, albeit not terribly attractive. The location is excellent--steps away from Times Square. The price was very reasonable, and the staff was friendly.",5,Shannon S,January 2019
946,Quality Times Square Experience,"Hotel Edison was a very quality experience. It's in the heart of Time Square, so you cannot get any closer to the action, which is incredibly convenient for any dining or Broadway plans you may have in the area. It's also centrally located for subway and taxi accessibility. The rooms were clean, the decor was fresh, and aside from being in the center of the city that never sleeps, the ambiance was relaxing. I intend to return to this hotel for future visits and would recommend you give it a visit!",4,Ann-Marie P,January 2019
947,Fantastic location and very comfortable rooms,Stayed here for 3 nights in January. Hotel was literally on Times Square. You walked out the hotel and were basically on broadway and 47th. Hotel had lovely Art Deco interior with modest sized rooms and very comfortable beds. Free WiFi also. Would definitely stay again,5,StuartHay,January 2019
948,Run down!,"Location was fabulous. Very close to Times Square and lots of amenities. Check in wasn’t too difficult. Room looked good on entering but little niggles soon showed. Very noisy heating system which we needed on constantly as the room was constantly cold. Windows were taped up with sticky tape and tinfoil!! Shower was great and toiletries very nice. Towels were very small and some were severely frayed. We didn’t get our room serviced one day. Housekeeping turned up at 8pm and my daughter was already in bed after a very busy day. Staff were all helpful and friendly. I understand that the hotel is in the middle of a refurbishment, but our room really wasn’t up to scratch!",2,AntjeWilkinson,January 2019
949,"After 20+ years, Still the Best","Although I have stayed at the Edison Hotel countless times after countless years, this last time was the best.  As always, it is the perfect location for any theater-goer.  The last time I was there, I walked out of the south door, crossed the street, and went directly intothe theater to se ""Hamilton.""  The next night I went out the north door directly into the theater to see ""The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time.  It doesn't get any better than that!Since my last visit, the entire hotel has been renovated.  What a masterful job.  The rooms are perfect -- modern, bright, spotless, with greatly upgraded TV service.  Thebest feature of the new rooms is the bathroom.  I could have stayed forever.  The ultra-modern but easy to use shower was utter perfection.  The tub-less shower area made it exceptionally easy to use.  What a pleasure to stay is such a great room.I thought I would miss my beloved ""Polish Tea Room"" restaurant because it too has been upgraded -- and just as successfully.  It's modern, bright, well-appointed and staff by knowledgeable, efficient staff members.  The selections are generous; the prices, perfect.The staff throughout the hotel was personable, pleasant, and knowledgeable  We were especially taken with the young lady nicknamed ""Skirt"" who checked us in.  She worked diligently to help us make a few changes in our reservations and accommodated every request.All in all, this was an excptionally great experience.  I can't wait to repeat it!!",5,Key West Charlie,January 2019
950,"Great Location, Excellent Service, Good Price","I really enjoyed my weekend stay at the Edison. The room was very clean and updated. Great choice of restaurants on the property, and right on Broadway. The staff were very friendly and helpful. You can't go wrong here!",5,Kristine M,January 2019
951,Good Hotel and smoke-free!,"Property is very well located - close to public transportation, restaurants, bars, shops, attractions, nightlife and right on Broadway. It’s a very touristy area. If you want to avoid crowds, this is not the aérea you want to stay in. Staff is friendly and accommodating. Arrived early morning and check in was not until 3pm. However, you can leave your luggage at their storage room (they charge for the service, which I’ve never had to pay before). Same at checkout. The room was ready before 3pm and I’ve received a courtesy text message letting me know - greatly appreciated. Hotel has a very popular Rum Bar located next to the elevators and there is security personnel 24 hours a day making sure only guest go up to the rooms. There are many elevators and you hardly have to wait to go up and down. Rooms are a bit more on the outdated side. Carpet on floors. Bed doesn’t have pillowtop. Sheets are good 100% cotton quality. Same with blackout window. Room has with flatscreen TV, desk and chair, safe and keurig coffee machine with options of coffee, tea and decaf coffee. And bottled water. All complimentary. Bathroom seems to be recently renovated. Walk-in shower with glass box doors and bars to hold on into if needed. Towels were fluffy. Both bedroom and bathroom were extremely clean. I did not use any hotel’s amenities other than lobby to wait for rides. Haven’t done at their restaurant either. Lobby has plenty of couches but often all occupied. Staff is friendly.",4,MrsWorldwide,January 2019
952,Great location great price great service!,"The Edison was a great hotel!  From the time we walked in the staff was extremely helpful in showing us where to check in, to the front desk staff, to the person bringing extra towels late, to the bell hops checking our bags on our last day.  Everyone had a smile on their face and so helpful!  The location was great - on Times Square but not right on Times Square which for us was great!  The price point was a big booking point for us.  There was 2 moms and 2 daughters and we had plenty of room for our quick trip.  We all said we would stay again.",5,mcruze,January 2019
953,Disappointed,"I had high expectations for this hotel based on its website and I was extremely disappointed. I had to ask to be move rooms 3 times before I got a room that I could fit my suitcase into and that’s not an exaggeration the first room I was given had damp walls so bad the wallpaper was hanging off the wall the furniture was very old the bed was an old double wooden bed the bathroom was awful the bath was chipped, old and stained yellow with an old dirty looking shower curtain hanging over it the toilet and sink were the same old and stained the heating system sounded like it was about to explode off the wall the second room wasn’t much better and finally the third room although still very small was a bit more updated but the dust sat thick under the heating system and the bed. The lobby is beautiful it’s just a pitty I can’t say the same for any of the rooms I was given! Staff were always friendly probably the only good thing about it",1,Mmoore,January 2019
954,Best Location for the Best Price,"We have stayed at the Edison several times in the past, and have never been disappointed. In the 10 years we have traveled to NYC, most of the rooms at the Edison have been renovated (some better than others) but overall, the hotel & rooms are clean, well maintained, and the staff members are awesome.  You cannot beat the location, especially with the price of the rooms.  We will be back!",5,Dan R,January 2019
955,Great hotel,"Great hotel in a great, centralized location. Stayed here many times. The rooms are beautiful and are a nice, comfortable size. Can’t go wrong with the Edison. Cant wait to go back. Staff is very friendly as well!",5,jrnewt,January 2019
956,Underwhelming....,"Would not rate this hotel as 4* as the room and bathroom were tiny.  The heating system sounded like it was going to explode and hot water was unpredictable..!! The only thing that made up for this were the happy, helpful staff, particularly Christine Lin, who made us feel very welcome indeed.",3,Carla M,January 2019
957,Location was great but disappointed ,"We waited in line twice, once to check in and then again to get our keys later.  We waited in the second line for about 45 minutes.   There were a ton of staff around but inexplicably 2 people checking people in.  We asked if this was normal and were told nonchalantly yes.  The bathroom was tiny with very poor lighting and the rooms could use some serious updating.  No mini fridge or coffee maker in the room.",2,Cassie R,January 2019
958,Executive Vice President,"Great location, clean room and excellent service by the staff. Was nice that there were supurb restaurants right on the premises. Rooms were recently renovated and there was no street noise from the 18th floor. Good bathroom amenities and free bottled water and coffee in the room a plus I give the Edison Hotel 5 stars for comfort and value.",5,Paul F,January 2019
959,"Location, Location, Location!","Spent 5 nights in a classic room! Check in was easy, staff fantastic, friendly, chatty and so helpful! The room was dated but this didn’t matter to us as we spent all day everyday out, just returned to sleep and everything in the room did the job perfectly. On Tuesdays and Fridays they have a complimentary hour with wine, a buffet and live music, everybody was friendly and as a couple not knowing anyone there we loved joining others for a chat and drink. The hotel location is everything, on the street outside our room was the Hamilton theatre and Times Square was literally a skip and jump from the front door! We ate away from Times Square as food and drink was overpriced, the same with gift shops who are allowed to add an extra 30% to products because of rental prices. We ate and found lovely bars along 4th and 5th with happy hours from 3-7pm in some. Left our bags at the hotel on the day of check out for just $2! Can not fault this hotel, only gave 4 stars not 5 as the room wasn’t as shown in the photos, that didn’t affect us but may others. This hotel is a must and would absolutely love to stay here again!",4,Joanne,January 2019
960,Fantastic location right in the middle of NCY,"Hotel Edison was the perfect location for our first time in NCY. We stayed for 5 nights and although it was noisy outside, the room was very quiet and it was easy to fall to sleep. The bed was very comfy and the heating worked really well. I would definitely stay here again!!!",5,Lauren S,December 2018
961,Really impressed,"What a well-managed and well-maintained hotel at a great price. The hotel is big/bustling. My room was small but had everything I needed, including a counter in the bathroom to spread out my stuff and electrical outlets in sensible places by the bed. When I made the reservation I was told I would have a renovated room, so in case they're not all renovated be sure to ask for that. We ate in the breakfast restaurant and Bond45 for dinner; both were good. I've been to the Rum Bar before: great atmosphere! So if you need a Times Square location at an affordable price, I recommend this hotel.",4,mnnow,January 2019
962,Excellent Location,"Couldn't of chosen a hotel in a better location!In the heart of Broadway, Times Square at the end of the street, a wealth of restaurants, cafes, places to eat on your door step.The hotel has popular bars but the hotels in the neighbourhood also have some great bars worth visiting. Loads of shopping also at the end of the street.Rooms were pleasant, we upgraded to a suite but had a look around some of the other rooms before confirming the one we wanted and all were well decorated and modern.",5,EricaLegg,December 2018
963,New York first time ,"First time at New York it was more than we expected. Hotel was clean, excellent location handy to all places we wanted to go. Only down side was the room was small, but would stay here again as the location is perfect. 911 was very emotional I would like to return and spend more time here. Would not recommend the night bus tour as not much to see. They hop on and off day tour of Down Town was good for getting from a to b. Took just over two hours to do the full circle.  So don’t stay on bus jump on and off as u go. Over all was good trip and will be back again.",4,Kelly E,January 2019
964,Great location!,Location was perfect! Staff were lovely and the Rum Bar was amazing! Would go back in a heartbeat. Make sure you try the waffles by the red stairs (which is about 10 steps away from the hotel). The best waffles EVER!!,5,Karene N,October 2018
965,Great to see the Big Apple location of hotel excellent,"Location is excellent ,restaurants great food.Rooms are a little dated bathroom especially could do with new wall paper.Beds very comfortable.Stayed on 7th floor could hear a lot of external noise which did affect sleep in morning.",3,M2022BHjohnf,January 2019
966,Mr Harvey Dening,"The all round cleanliness, superb location in Times Square and so close to broadway theatres and all round staff service was excellent throughout the stay and I would recommend to others staying here and would return back to this hotel!",5,Harvey D,January 2019
967,Excellent location,"The hotel location couldn't be any closer to Times Square and a nearby subway. Food was okay but a bit expensive. Our room was standard size for New York - small but in fairness you don't come to New York to spend time in your hotel room! It was a bit dated, especially the bathroom and shower. The location makes this an ideal hotel to stay in.",4,MollyG24,February 2018
968,"check in, room, checkout and concierge were peerless","easy to get to appointments from all the nearby subway stops.  Bed, room, room amenities (towels sheets, etc.) were first rate.  The check in was friendly and fast.  the security was careful, the doormen helpful and the restaurant surprisingly good.",5,james,January 2019
969,"ONLY positive is the location and Bond45. Very disappointed with everything else, extreme disrepair.","In the city to celebrate a 13th Birthday, left very disappointed with our actual stay. It began when I responded to  ""Contact us if we may be of assistance prior to your arrival"" in an email for dinner suggestions, and never received a response.  Do not offer to be of assistance if you won't actually respond.  We notified the front desk of our arrival at noon, aware that check in was not until 3, and we were told our room would be ready between 2-2:30.  At 2:30, we were told to check back at 3, then at 3, told to come back at 3:30. (30 minutes passed the regular check in time) When I explained we were originally told 2/2:30, and we had somewhere to be at 3:30, we were given a room that suddenly became available, but not without clear annoyance from person ""helping"" us. The first room had the wrong beds, so we were given a second room that also ""suddenly"" became available.  Both rooms were nearly identical in quality and condition but I will speak only about the room we actually stayed in. VERY dingy, worn and downright unpleasant.  Window shades were broken and unusable, rug was torn and buckled in several places and an extreme tripping hazard.  Bathroom tub had clearly been painted many times, 10 years ago, to hid cracks, rust, disrepair. Not to mention several things that did not affect our actual stay, but were part of the negative experience.  Torn, falling wall paper, broken tiles, loose window.Fully aware we had booked a classic room and not a signature, there are still NO pictures online that even remotely show what the two rooms we saw accurately looked like under the classic category. It felt like a classic bait and switch.  I strongly suggest the Hotel Edison not put paying customers in these rooms until they can be even slightly remodeled.  The day after we left, I did respond to an email survey asking about our stay and I was even more candid with our displeasure than I am here on this public forum, and have yet to receive a response.  The only portion of the Edison I can recommend is the excellent location to everything in the city, and the food at Bond 45, brunch was amazing. We come to NYC several times a year since we are in the New England area, and unfortunately would not even consider staying here again.",2,eml424,January 2019
970,I have stayed here 3 times,"The hotel is clean. It is safe, and the front staff are super helpful and friendly. My room was a little small, but I don't come to New York to stay in my room. That being said, everything worked in my room from the heater/AC to the HBO on the TV.. You can see that they are making an effort to modernize things without massive disruptions to the guests. Overall, what can I say other than I will stay there again.I was asked to do a survey for them on their use. I was sent a personal message by De’Marcus Woods, Guest Relations Ambassador.I do appreciate the small things like a personal message when I take the time to give you feedback.",4,Jeff,January 2019
971,Review of Hotel Edison NYC,This hotels location couldn't be better. It is very clean and the staff makes you feel very welcomed. There us also a guest party by management on Tuesday- nice touch.Both if the restaurants in this hotel are great- but my favorite is Bond 45.We have visited here 5 times and will continue to do so.Like I said- ALL the staff are so accommodating.,5,lindazee817,January 2019
972,Excellent and customer service,"A week after my stay, I called the hotel about 2 rings I had left in the room. The front desk transferred me to Security. I was told they would look for them and asked for my contact info. I didn’t hold out much hope, but 20 minutes later I received an email from security informing me they had found my rings! After a few emails that were going to “junk” and resolving a firewall issue, John Bracero had my rings shipped to me. He continued to contact me to resolve the email issue to make sure the rings we returned. Excellent customer service!!!",5,1twistedginger,December 2018

974,Excellent hotel and location,"We stayed at the Edison hotel on october2018 as our 1st time in newyork we had rooms 406,604,606 and the rooms were clean and comfortable  the hotel staff from doorman,reception,security staff to the room cleaning staff couldn't be any more polite and helpful location is 30 meters from times square red stairs  with Danny deli next door to hotel for good food 24hours a day",5,Tam C,October 2018
975,Fantastic location rooms are acceptable,"If you want to stay in the heart of times square this hotel is a great one for you. If you're planning not to spend time in the hotel it is fine. The rooms are tiny, check in is slow (15-20 mins). Bathrooms are just about acceptable. In July air conditioning was required it was a big box which took up half the room and made loud noise all night long, not good if you are a light sleeper.",3,Pauline G,August 2018
976,Great location ,"We came here for a 50th birthday weekend for my better half, if you want to be right in the heart of where it’s all happening then this is the perfect Hotel to stay, the other good thing was that it wasn’t noisy so you could actually get a nights sleep even though your at Times Square. The room was very clean and came with a safe at no extra charge. We would stay here again.",5,Howie/Bryans,January 2019
977,Review of the Edison October 2018,"We stayed in the Edison for 8 nights in October.  It was a fantastic hotel with the perfect location, Times Square just steps away.  The staff were very helpful and friendly at all times.  Check in was very quick even though it was busy, and upon check out they allowed us to store our luggage until our shuttle picked us up.  The bed was very comfy and the room and bathroom was immaculately clean.  I would stay here again.",5,irishcailin,October 2018
978,Location Location Location ,"The highlight here is location, steps away from Times Square and Broadway shows, minutes away from walking to Rockefeller Center and a short walk to Central Park. October marked my first trip to NY and we booked the hotel for price and location. But you get what you pay for. Overall the hotel common areas were nice but the room was in need of updating. The wallpaper was peeling and carpet was unraveling plus there was plywood over one of the windows in the room. It was jarring at first but at least the staff and cleanliness of the hotel were good and for location it is outstanding.",3,Cassaundra F,October 2018
979,Birthday celebration,"We visited New York to celebrate my wife’s birthday with 3 other couples. The location of this hotel is very convenient to everything around Times Square, the theater district and restaurant row. The hotel is an older hotel, very retro decor and well maintained. The entire hotel staff does everything they can do to make your stay a wonderful experience. There are two restaurants in the building that have very good food and drinks.",5,Robert S,January 2019
980,excellent service and location!,"This place is the perfect spot to stay for a visit to new york. With close proximity to the subway and steps from times square, the Edison has everything a tourist needs. Its extremely comfortable and spacious for NYC hotels. Will continue to go here in the future.",5,Richard K,January 2019
981,Anxious to Return!,"The Hotel Edison is literally steps away from everywhere you’ll want to be in Manhattan. From the moment we arrived, we were greeted by the friendly and wonderful staff. Tommy, the Bell Captain was amazing! He helped get us checked in to our beautiful suite and recommended a number of places and restaurants that were fantastic. We loved the View Restaurant Tommy! The staff at Hotel Edison went above and beyond to make our stay a memorable one. Our Signature Suite was clean and spacious - positively huge by New York standards. And be sure to check out Bond 45, our breakfast was delicious!",5,MikeDeniseP,August 2018
982,Great Hotel All Around,My husband and I stayed here on a Saturday night and it was awesome.  The rooms were so clean and nicely decorated! The amenities in the room were great- even free WiFi!  The location couldn’t be better if you are hitting the theater district.  The staff was so helpful and friendly! We will definitely be coming back! Also- very affordable!,5,M Keenan,January 2019
983,Great hotel,We came down to the city for a short one  night stay and had a great time! We booked a signature suite for two couples that was above expectation.when we arrived we were greeted by Roger Lindsey who escorted us to the front desk. he was very friendly and recommended great places for food and drinks.the hotel had a great location close to good restaurants and attractions.our suite was clean and comfortable.my wife and I come to the city several times a year and we will definitely be staying here again!,5,Matt,January 2019
984,Non-Denominational Blessings to MARCOS SOSA!,"(as requested, and well worth doing)... he was responsible for a (very?) late check out at no additional cost. The King Suite (king + pullout couch) was very clean. The fridge was nice. The THREE reg. sized bottles of water was extra sweet. There was a proper bath tub (with the lean'y part in the back!) included in the shower. We come a few times per year, this happened to be onsale/cheapest. Pleasantly surprised!",5,BroadwayNerd,January 2019
985,Great Stay,"We stayed here for 3 nights during a Multi-City Trip consisting of New York, San Francisco and Las Vegas.New York was our first stop and the Hotel Edison was our chosen Hotel. Firstly the location is amazing. Less than a minute walk to Times Square. I would say this is the hotels main selling point. Simply amazing.The room quality was average I’d say. Rooms were slightly cosy, however, its New York and space is a premium. Had all the features we wanted/needed for a 3-night stay. Nice warm room (February Stay), plenty of hot water and a comfortable bed. The reception staff were more than friendly and I can't complain about the Hotel Edison. Would happily stay again.",5,Christoper L,February 2018
986,Trip to NYC,"Our stay at the Edison Hotel was short. Accommodations were modest, as the hotel is an older one. Glad to report that the room was neat and clean. Can’t beat the location for convenience to Times Square and the theatre district. Hotel staff was friendly and helpful. Hope to stay here again for future visits!",5,Tootie740,December 2018
987,Worst part of the trip,"We stayed at this hotel for 5 nights in December our first time in NYC and first in the USA. The hotel is right in the heart of the city and everything is on your doorstep. This is the only poitive feedback I can give. I hated going back to this hotel, it was the worst part of the day, the hotel is like something out of a horror movie, it's dark and creepy but I could cope with this it was an old hotel afterall. We booked 2 rooms one for myself and husband, the other for our 2 teenage daughters. They put us in rooms next door but one to each other this was not a problem the problem was who they put in between us. I can only think we had a hooker next to us (a very busy hooker at that) everytime our neighbour came back and pretty much straight away we would hear very suspicious and very loud noises, then they would leave. I can not count how many times this happen but it was ever time we were our room and every day/night for 3 of our 5 nights. Our daughters thought it was hilarious! I am pleased that business was good for her/him but when I think of my trip to this amazing city I think of this horrible hotel and never ever would I stay here again.",1,Jan L,December 2018
988,Very nice hotel,Very nice hotel room a bit small but didn't mind was only sleeping in it. Reception and staff very friendly and helpful. Resort fees very cheap. 42 dollars for 4 nights. Very close to Times square. Lovely deli next door for breakfast. Security is also great.,4,Nic D,November 2018
989,Excellent hotel ,"We stayed here for 5 nights. The staff were friendly and the hotel was perfectly located with restaurants and shops nearby. Right next to Times Square. I visited with family, my room was a good size, comfortable bed and a bath. My family’s room was a renovated room but it was smaller than mine and they’d a shower instead of a bath. We would definitely stay here again.",5,JamesStrong35,January 2019
990,A Wonderful NY Hotel,The Hotel Edison has Art Deco style and charm. The staff is excellent and cordial. The rooms are clean and comfortable. They also provide a complimentary buffet and live jazz happy hour on some days. I highly recommend this hotel for a great NYC experience. I would stay at the Hotel Edison over any name corporate hotel anytime.,5,Tom L.,January 2019
991,Birthday trip,We stayed at Edison NY for 3 nights. Was my birthday celebration- hotel under renovation and coming along but still has a way to go to reach 5 stars. Have been staying here for many years and it is good to see the many improvements that are being made especially the rooms. Hotel is in a great location for theater and restaurants.,4,Carole W,January 2019
992,Ask for a remodeled room,"We just returned from a one night stay at the Hotel Edison. We have stayed there on numerous occasions because of the location, Friedman’s Cafe and the well appointed rooms. This time however, we were assigned a room that left us with several concerns. Room 620 was very clean with enough space. However, we could not connect to the internet ( after multiple attempts), there was no coffee maker in the room, the fan in the heater was very loud and ran intermittently making it difficult to sleep and, while this may seem trivial, we  prefer a room with a light on both sides of the bed ( there 2 of us in a queen size bed). We didn’t spend a lot of time in the room so we don’t consider this experience  to be a “deal breaker” for us at the Edison. However, in the past we have stayed in newly remodeled rooms that rated 5 stars, with all of the mentioned needs met. We’ll go back to the Edison, but we will request a remodeled room.",3,Alice L,January 2019
993,Worst hotel ever,"This hotel is awful. Mould on the walls, wallpaper hanging off, disgusting. We got moved as we complained but still wasn’t great. According to the manager this is typical of a start room and pretty pics on website are the upgrades!! Total joke!! Would never stay there again!!",1,Dree1981,December 2018
994,Fantastic Charming Hotel Stay,This is not my first stay at this wonderful home away from home. From the minute you walk in the door and the friendly attentive faces waiting to help you check in. Easy and pleasurable. I was alone this trip was given a beautiful room with all amenities. Room spot on clean. They provide you with anything you need . I highly recommend staying at the Edison as I know I will the next time I am in town. Sorry to leave. Great restaurants and bar in house.,5,DavidK1030,January 2019
995,"Historical Hotel, excellent position","Nice hotel in excellent position in Time Square.Pay attention: Queen Room is not in accordance with photos showed in booking.com, especially bathroom that is not the best!All the rest is very good. Close restaurant BOND 45 for breakfast is more than excellent!",4,Emanuele C,January 2019
996,Brilliant location,"We may have had to climb over the toilet to get to the bath & they tried to tell us a double double room was 2 singles, but the bed area was roomy, it was an awesome location & the error was resolved quickly thanks to our travel agent; right in the heart of Times Square. Highly recommend.",5,Tineale V,November 2018
997,Christmas at the Edison Hotel NYC,"Well what can I say.... was a great stay over Christmas!Fantastic location...right in the midst of Times Square.   I would recommend anyone to stay here, very very convenient!After reading some of the reviews did get a little dubious about the noise as it seriously is a minutes walk from Times Square.But no worries, as we were in Room 1717, which is obviously on the 17th Floor and it was just perfect.   Great black out screens on the window too As with someone else stated, and this is not really a complaint, and that the pillows, if there are two people, generally you like two pillows each ~ but it was no biggie!  The room was quite small (queens signature room) but tbh that too was just fine as really were were out 95% of the time.  Very comfy bed, fantastic shower and not a bad view, even if it was 17 floors up!! :)All in all im baffled by some of the reviews on here as it was just perfect.Loved the art deco in the hotel ~ just beautiful!  I found the housekeeping staff very very polite and friendly as well as the reception staff ~ not forgetting the guy who checks your keys before you get on the lift ~ nice to know this is a very secure hotel.The restaurants were great, pretty much had breakfast at the Friedmans every morning and loved the bars at the hotel... all in all ~ it made our christmas and will definately be returning... maybe in the summer this time :)",5,Chelseagirl65,December 2018
998,"Poor stay, Poor customer service, ","It all began at check-in,Gentlemen who checked us in said 3 words and none of them were hello- ID- Credit Card- Sign HereNot once did he establish eye contact or acknowledge there was 2 people standing in front of him, a really poor interaction from the front of house. I went on to confirm with him that we had paid for a late check out of 4pm. His response of No, it's 1pm and if you want 4pm it's $100( again all this while looking down tapping away at his keyboard). I showed my booking confirmation which showed 4pm and that we had already paid for this. This was met with silence and 2 forms to initial showing a 1pm checkout which I had to again remind him it's 4pm and I proceeded to cross it out and write 4pm as did not want hassles the following day....how wrong I was.Next morning as we were heading out for breakfast cleaner asks what time our checkout was. I let her know 4pm which was met with a surprised look. We returned as wife was not feeling too well and I headed back out for some last minute shopping, as leaving cleaner who was still in the hallway mentioned she was told our checkout was 1pm , so I decided to clear it up at the front desk.This time it was Tex who I spoke to. Explained the situation and again no different to last night was met with a "" no sorry it's 1pm we don't have late check-out available today, you can leave your bags here if you like"" not impressed I told him sorry we won't be leaving our bags we will be staying in the room until 4pm for which we paid for. I showed him a confirmation of our booking showing that we paid for the 4pm late check-out. He went out back to speak to a manager and returned and apologized for the confusion and said it has all been sorted, stamped a note to confirm it all. (Or So we thought) not 10 minutes later someone calls the room asks if it is room 1830 once confirmed they hung up.... 30 seconds later another call from from desk, this time again trying to say checkout is not 4pm and to come down stairs to speak to the manager Eric. By this stage we were furious with the constant badgering and then the added knocking on the door from housekeeping to see if we were in the room.As the saga continues I then spoke to Eric as requested, had to explain the whole thing again and again was met by your checkout is 1pm... I explained that 10 minutes ago Tex had spoken to a manager  and it was ok, now I'm having to explain  again . I showed  him confirmation of 4pm checkout which this time he took a copy and apologized. I get back up to the room and what do you know they keys have been deactivated, so back down again for the 3rd time so could get back in....And now onto the roomWe had booked a Signature King with Terrace. Either we got assigned the wrong room or the pictures on the website are very misleading( have attached our pics of room). King bed yes, bathroom yes. Terrace, not sure you could call it that for one I'm not sure how 1 person could fit there and secondly it was locked and could not even access it? We definitely would not recommend this hotel to anyone especially if customer service is your priority. Do yourself a favour and stay well clear, I know we will.",2,Schumi5,January 2019
999,Great that it is on Times Square,That we were stayed in a suit and it was very nice. The Rum House was great we never tried the breakfast as there are a lot of mom and pop kind of places if you walk a little but at  9:00 at night it is great to go to the Rum House and get some drinks and music. The noise was to that bad saying it is on Times Square. It is great how theaters are like next to it. Some of the negatives are that it has some problems like the rooms are old and that when we got there the toilet did not work but they fixed that when we were gone so that was not bad. Other then that it is a really nice hotel for being that old.,4,Mason Shaw,December 2018
